# Conversion Rate Optimization

The digital world is nothing if not flexible, this gives us as marketers and product developers a lot of leverage in the ability to constantly improve, modify and optimize our product to best suite our target audience, both in our marketing funnels, the content we create, as well as our core product. CRO aims for minimum user friction, maximum conversion rate and feature adoption thereby having a better overall user experience.
