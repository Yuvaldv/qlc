Below are resources such as in-house courses and articles for each of the platforms we’ll be working with. Do confer with your mentor to see which tools you’ll be using specifically.

## Google Analytics (GA)

URL: [analytics.google.com](analytics.google.com)

[Google Analytics for Beginners](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6) - Units 2 and 3 only, the rest are irrelevant.

[Advanced Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/7&) - Units 1 and 3 only, the rest are irrelevant.

*You’ll need for your mentor to allow your Gmail account access to their GA account.

## Google Data Studio

URL: [datastudio.google.com](https://datastudio.google.com/)

[Knowledge base](https://support.google.com/datastudio/answer/6390659?utm_source%3Din-product%26utm_medium%3Dfeature-panel%26utm_campaign%3Dvideos)

Just connect your data sources such as GA and SQL server so you can easily create customized reports as well as use the templates made available by Google.

## Google Optimize

URL: [optimize.google.com](https://optimize.google.com/)

While the [Resource library](https://support.google.com/360suite/optimize/) may seem a little clunky in its UX, it does cover all the bases, and Optimize is a pretty straight-forward and user-friendly product.

## Optimizely

URL: [app.optimizely.com](https://app.optimizely.com/)

Optimizely [Resource library](https://help.optimizely.com) will lead you through all the steps required to create and run a successful A/B test facilitating insights into specific modifications to your web page. From creating page variations with their editor to running your test and analyzing the results to validate or disprove your hypothesis.

## Google Sheets, Excel and CSVs

You’ll need competency with:

- Pivot Tables
- VLOOKUP & HLOOKUP
- Absolute and Relative Cell References i.e F4
- Filters and Tables
- Graphs and Charts
