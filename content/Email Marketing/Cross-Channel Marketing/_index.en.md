An email address offers a lot more than an inbox to deliver messages to. Using email addresses we’re able to engage our list with push, in-app and in-site messages and notifications which we can then personalize to increase conversion and engagements. We’re also able to retarget them via social media ads, mobile ads, search and display ads.

While SMS marketing does require collecting the users' phone number, this powerful integration is available on most email marketing platforms.

By consolidating or [integrating](zapier.com) our existing customer engagement data sources (such as product analytics, social media, etc) with our email marketing data, we’re able to further segment our user base and deliver personalized messages across different platforms depending on user engagement. Do advise with your product or data leader on avenues of implementation.

All of these are obviously not exclusive to email addresses alone.
