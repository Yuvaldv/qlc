# Email Marketing

Though Social Media Marketing seems to be the trending channel of customer acquisition nowadays, email marketing surprisingly averages at 174% the conversion rate of SMM and has consistently kept its stand with the highest Return-on-Investment (ROI) averaging at 4400% which translates to an approximate $44 revenue for every dollar spent. Email marketing today is much different than it used to be in the past, with cross-platform marketing automation being an explosive feature that's leading the charge with 152% higher click-through-rate (CTR) than generic marketing messages.
