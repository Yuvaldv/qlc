Generally, the two constant metrics in email marketing are click-through-rate (CTR) indicating whether a link within the email content has been clicked, and open rate indicating whether the email has been opened, with the latter being slightly biased towards underperformance due to technical issues we’ll get into in our analytics section.

Though these metrics generally describe how our users interact with our emails, they don’t describe a business goal we aim to achieve via these email campaigns, of which we will now talk about.

Email campaign goals generally fall under one of these categories:

## Conversion, Action, Engagement, Feedback or Trust

**Conversion** refers to subscribers clicking through our email via a call-to-action (CTA) and registering to an event, private beta, newsletter, social presence or other.

**Action** refers to subscribers clicking through our email, visiting our website and making a purchase, account upgrade or other fiscal transaction.

**Engagement** refers to subscribers clicking through our email, visiting our website and engaging with our content. We measure engagement success via metrics such as CTR, Session duration, pages-per-session, time-on-page, bounce-rate, etc..

**Feedback** refers to subscribers filling feedback forms aimed at creating case studies, reviews, segmentations and more.

**Trust** refers to emails about changes in privacy policy, product recalls or other notices aimed at keeping customer trust and being transparent about current occurrences, good or bad.
