Marketing automation, often referred to as lifecycle marketing, drip campaigns or message personalization involves creating user flows depending on their continuous interaction with our emails- links clicked, email opens, web content such as videos interacted with, etc.

Optimally we’ll want to create a drip campaign for each goal & personalize it per customer segment, such as stage in the customer journey, i.e the number or drip campaigns we’ll have is equal to (Goals x Segments).

Often times though we’ll rely on the drip campaign itself to do the segmenting, splitting customers into groups throughout the campaign-flow depending on their interactions.

Marketing automation has a couple of properties you can use to personalize the flow, in [MailChimp](https://kb.mailchimp.com/automation/all-the-automation-triggers), for example, these would be

- [Trigger](https://kb.mailchimp.com/automation/all-the-automation-triggers)[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://kb.mailchimp.com/automation/all-the-automation-triggers&sa=D&ust=1518143468506000&usg=AFQjCNEDKZCGM1f4Gk726JxaPn2FerZ7fQ)- The trigger starting the current phase of automation flow and sending an email

- Previous emails clicked
- Specific links in previous emails clicked
- Previous emails not opened
- Delay - A delay in between the trigger and sending the email.
