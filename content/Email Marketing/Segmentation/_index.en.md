# Understanding our email list

Personalized email messages today comprise 58% of all marketing revenue, improve CTR by an average of 14% and conversions by an average of 10% in relating to generic marketing messages.

By segmenting our existing email list into smaller groups with different types of audiences we may effectively personalize the types of content & messages we’ll want to deliver to those audiences to better intrigue & engage them.

Our audience segments can vary widely depending on our market, our product, and our audiences. Optimally we would use our buyer personas or user personas to offer ideas for how to segment our audience.

Just in case these are non-existent here are a few examples to tickle your fancy:

Some business facing segments might include:
```
- Job function
- Industry
- Company size
- Seniority
- Country
- Timezone
- Language
```
A few consumer-facing examples would be:
```
- Geolocation
- Place of Residence
- Timezone
- Language
- Gender
```
A few segment examples concerning user-brand engagement could be:
```
- Cart Abandonment more than 12 ago.
- More than 1 month since last visit on the website.
- Less than a week since last social engagement (like, comment, etc.)
- Less than 3 weeks since last purchase
- Purchased from category X
- Registered to our website without purchasing over 3 days ago
- Customer lifecycle stage
- Opened welcome email
- Clicked through welcome email
```
Just as there are many types of segments, there are also many types of methods to collect the user-data required for the segmentation, some examples of these methods may be:

- Manually or automatically scraping social profiles by email address or full name
- Asking multiple choice questions as part of the initial registration form. These would preferably be optional fields.
- Using [Zapier](zapier.com), or similar, to link data from our website, social presence, analytics platform or other, and attribute it to users in our email marketing platform.
- Include a segmenting question in our welcome email, with several clickable answers, each directing the user to a similar thank you page, and segmenting them into different groups appropriately.

Once we’ve segmented our audience into sufficiently small and relevant groups we’ll be able to better personalize and automate the messages we send them, with the aim of increasing our CTR, in-site engagement, conversion rates and open-rates, from our current baselines, and per audience segment.
