## Introduction

It’s important to note that you will not be fed with a silver spoon, neither while learning from our curriculums nor while participating in our projects.

You are about to embark on your very first professional experience in the global tech industry. Short as it may seem, it may offer immense value. from portfolio-ready materials you’ll be creating, to real-world understanding of * behavioral economics*, *2017 Nobel prize winning subject.*

While our curriculums will onboard you to professional terminology & role-fundamentals, you are expected to learn on your feet, aim for real-world results & research continuously, just like any other employee working the digital industry.

This could be the starting point of your career, the initial experience you'll acquire towards attaining a junior position from which you will grow. But only if you play it right.

## Preliminary Work

Before starting work on your project, it's well advised to get to know the brand and market you'll be operating in.

1. Keep work environments handy - bookmark your project dashboard resource library, shared documents, trello boards, and all other work tools & channels to your bookmarks bar.
2. Check our glossary for reference on the language and terminology of the digital landscape so as to understand what your peers and managers are asking.
3. Search and review your brand website on [SimilarWeb](http://similarweb.com) and [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/),
4. Search for your competition on google using your brand keywords, pinpoint 3-5 main competitors, in terms of traffic using SimilarWeb.
5. Research your competitors as relating to your project-scope - whether it’s their social presence, email marketing automation flow, sales pitch, etc. Make sure to gather some insight into how your competitors operate beforehand.
6. Review the curriculum again focusing on the parts most relevant for your specific project.

## Project Communications

Ping your Project Mentor (PM) at project initiation to send you access to the tools and platforms your team will be working with, log in to all the platforms and check that you’re all set up for working on the project, ask your PM to resolve any log-in or credential problems you're encountering.

Throughout each day as you work on the project, stay attentive to your communication and task platforms for any project related chatter, insights, progress, and dilemmas-- these are the project’s main line of communications.

If on some days you happen to be preoccupied with unrelated issues, which is quite alright, make sure to still be attentive to your project's communications and be responsive throughout the day via mobile or desktop.

Attend weekly face-to-face, these will be scheduled by your PM and conducted via video chat platforms such as slack, zoom or skype. It’s important to understand that these meetings are only there for a broad review of the team and project progress, while the actual project management is conducted asynchronously via the communication and project management platforms.

If you happen to miss a face-to-face meeting, make sure to let your PM know before the meeting, review the meeting summary and add your own notes after.

Make sure to keep your deliverables in an immediately shareable format, preferably google docs where live-collaboration is unmatchable. This serves both cross-team-pollination, peer-review, and PM review as asynchronous processes.

## Validated learning and results-driven orientation

While your project Objectives and Key-Performance-Indicators (KPIs) will be defined by your PM, in order to maximize the added value you’ll gain from the project it’s important to understand the following:

Being able to say you worked on a project **p** for company **c** just isn’t enough for your long-term success nor your current HR positioning.

On the other hand, being able to say that while working on project **p** for company **c** you’ve learned of behaviour **b** regarding audience **a** through a [validated learning process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validated_learning) and that you achieved an **x,y,z** elevation in  KPIs **k, p, i** resulting in **g** overall growth, sounds like you’re hired.

## Our Goal

Our aim here at QLC is for you to utilize the experience, knowledge, and deliverables achieved via this project to attain and secure your next, and possibly first position in the global tech-industry, only through your successful assimilation in this job market do we at QLC achieve success.
