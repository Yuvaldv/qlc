## Preface

SEO work relies heavily on content and aims to elevate our websites ranking on search results. Generally speaking, our content is indexed by the search engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, etc.) and ranked via their internal algorithms per keyword and search-term. Thus when a user searches or queries the search-engine, the results presented to him in the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), relies on how each website was indexed and it’s ranking for that particular search term. The website ranking is dependent on the number of backlinks it’s getting, the web-ranking of those backlinkers, once again per search-term, the relevance of our website content to those search-terms, our sites technical performance, speed, responsiveness, accommodation for mobile users, and more. So while content is indeed the base upon which SEO work stands on, there’s definitely a lot more to it.

In this guide we'll offer several free tools for SEO work, it should be noted that these free tools can only go so far, and having an arsenal of paid tools such as Moz and SEMRush gives out a huge advantage in managing and strategizing SEO work.
