SEO managers don’t necessarily have to understand the entirety of technical details and specifications involved in managing all that’s written below while they need to coordinate with their developer team to appropriately include them in the page markup (HTML code).

## MetaData

Each of our pages metadata indicates to the search engine indexing it exactly what this page is all about. It may include our URL, page-title, meta-description, meta-keywords, alternative-text, and HTML formatting such as titles (H1, H2, etc.), bold and italic text. All these are crawled and indexed for each page of our website so the search engine e.g Google, can understand the context of the page to our entire website and the broader web community so it can rate it appropriately.

Having a focused meta-data experience throughout each of our website’s pages contributes highly to our SEO indexing, keyword placement, and overall status.

[MozBar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mozbar/eakacpaijcpapndcfffdgphdiccmpknp) is an absolutely game-changing tool for evaluating our pages metadata.


## Subject URLs

URLs may be configured in any number of ways. Some supportive of SEO and some counterproductive. Putting an article number such as ‘qlc.io/blog/article-15474’ means nothing to the search engine indexing our website. But putting the article title inside the URL as such ‘qlc.io/blog/forming-your-brand-identity’ forces the search engine to index keywords per page, elevating our rank per those keywords.


## Mobile First Indexing, AMP & Loading Time

Website performance is getting more and more impactful on SEO ranking, thus pages and websites with prolonged loading times (measurable via chrome developer tools or [MozBar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mozbar/eakacpaijcpapndcfffdgphdiccmpknp), which are not adapt to mobile users will see their rank dropping.

Google has already started ranking websites using mobile-first-indexing meaning that any website that isn’t fit for mobile users and doesn’t use Accelerated Mobile Pages ([AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/)) will suffer in SERPs.
