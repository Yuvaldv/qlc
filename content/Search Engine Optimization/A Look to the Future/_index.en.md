Page metatags are currently going through a stage of evolvement, moving towards contextualizing interconnections between different pages and domains via Linked Data i.e data that links web pages and web-components such as images or videos to a bigger context not only across our own website but across the entire web.

Semantic Web initiatives such as Google’s & Microsoft’s [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) attempt to crawl and index Linked Data and map out these contextual connections across the web.

## JSON-LD

JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data aims to contextualize each page and domain to another. It entails in-page HTML markup such as @context, @id, @type, @language and more.

## RDFa

While JSON-LD markup aims to contextualize webpages, RDFa, which is now used by Facebook’s [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/), aims to contextualize in-page components such as images and videos which were previously uncrawled by search engines.
