Link building is an acute part of SEO work, and refers to accumulating websites that that link back to our website, otherwise known as Backlinks. Quality backlinks coming from credible and high-ranking websites have a pivotal-role in ranking our website in SERPs. There are many methods, white-hat (legitimate), as well as black-hat (illegitimate) to procuring backlinks - obviously when dealing with black hat methods, such as buying links from 3rd party vendors theres a lot of risk and a small rewards if any, and these methods will many times cause more harm than good to your SEO status.

## Acquiring Blacklinks

Backlinks are links arriving at our website from outside sources. Quality backlinks coming from credible and high-ranking websites have a pivotal role in ranking our website in SERPs. Similarly, backlinks arriving from low-ranking or untrustworthy websites lower our ranking upon indexing.

### Credibility & Reputation

Not all backlinks are created the same, in fact there are some backlinks that can even hurt your position on SERPs, depending on where they're coming from. This has to do with the credibility and reputation of the website who's doing the backlinking, if it's a low-reputation site such as a scam, porn-site, black-hat forum, the backlink provided will most likely reduce our SEO position. if it's from a very well established website with good reputation, let's take TechCrunch for the sake of example, then it can even elevate our SEO ranking ten-fold.

## Interlinks, Website & Content Organization

Interlinks are links from one page on our domain to another page on the same domain. While Interlinks won’t elevate our SEO ranking in any way, they will make our website more index-digestible and engage our user-base more effectively by advising with the content-segments and user-engagement with one article opening up to several more to keep session-engagement on our domain, as well as allow backlinkers to link to article-series instead of just one article.

### Other Tips for improving SEO Ranking

#### Publish Long Content (at least 1,000+ words)
Data from a few industry studies indicate the correlation between long content (1000+ words) and higher rankings. This is not difficult to understand, as mentioned in “Longtail Keywords” section, as the number of long-tail searches performed are increasing every day. Additionally, web users are becoming smarter every day. They want specific answers to specific questions. The long-form content pieces perform better and add immense value to your audience by going beyond just scratching the surface. Your content strategy needs to match their increasing savvy.

#### Email Outreach

The first step of any email outreach campaign is to find people that already write about your content’s topic. You could go to the blog directory site [ALLTop.com](https://alltop.com/) and search, for example,  “best **'your topic'** blogs”. Then, you could choose the sites from the results and make further efforts to have them check out your content.

 To get in touch the people you just found, the **two-step email outreach** process.

-	Step 1 : To avoid annoying someone that is not interested in your content, the first email is a “feeler” email, which just simply gauges the person’s interest in your content.

-	Step 2 : If you receive the response, then you could start your pitch.

The **two-step email outreach** process converts much better while most people send their link pitch in their first email and get poor reply rate.
