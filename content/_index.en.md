[QLC](https://qlc.io) is a startup specializing in online experiential education, offering remote education bundles that include a courses along with remote internships operated with real startups from across the globe.

During my time with QLC i've defined and deployed a git-based, xAPI compliant, LMS.

I've also created the entirety of our in-house curriculums and knowledge base.

Throughout this website you'll find samples of the courses and curriculums i've created for QLC.
