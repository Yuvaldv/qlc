# Quarter Life Crisis Curriculums

[QLC](https://qlc.io) is a startup specializing in online experiential education offering remote education bundles that included course and remote internships with startups and digital businesses across the globe.

During my time with QLC i've defined and deployed a git-based, xAPI compliant, LMS.

I've also created the entirety of our in-house curriculums and knowledge base.

Throughout this website you'll find samples of the courses and curriculums i've created for QLC.
