**CPC** Cost per Click (CPC) is an ad payment model where you pay for each click on your ad instead of just the ad being viewed. If the ad is presented to a user and isn't clicked, you don't pay.

**CPL**: Cost per Lead (CPL) is an ad payment model where you pay for each qualified lead, meaning not only was the ad presented to the user, and not only did he click it, he also filled out a form or clicked a CTA which qualifies him as a lead.

**CPA**: Cost per Action (CPA) refers to the total cost of converting someone wherein action generally refers to a financial transaction or a purchase engaged by the user.

**Referral Rate**: Your referral rate is the volume of referred purchases as a % of your total purchases. So a 1% referral rate means that 1 in 100 purchases at your store happen through your referral program. An Advocate shares a referral link (typically via social media, email or IM).

**Growth**: Our growth indicates how our KPI is measuring up in relation to past results per the same KPI.

Specific growth and Average (mean) growth may be calculated via these two simple formulas

$specificGrowth = \frac{present - past}{past}$
Calculates growth between two timestamps

$avgGrowth = (\frac{recentTime}{firstTime})^\frac{1}{n} -1 $
Calculates average growth between *n* timestamps

**Rate**: The rate of any KPI such as Churn Rate, Growth Rate, Conversion Rate etc. how our KPIs performance is measuring up in relation to the overall audience it was exposed to.

If for instance we got an average of 20 post likes per day, a month ago, where our entire page followers were 200, and today we have an average of 40 post likes per day with a following of 1200 users, it’s safe to say our user engagement is on the decline.

Rate is simply calculated as such:
$\frac{metric}{audience}$

**Avearge**: While working in digital marketing it's important to differentiate and understand the different kind's of averages: __Mean, Median, Mode, and Range__

Mean: The mean average is what your used to-- taking the overall sum and dividing by the number of numbers included.

$ MeanAvg = \frac{Sum}{#ofNumbers} $
$ MeanAvg(4,4,4,10,15,15,112) = \frac{164}{7} = 23.43 $

Median: The median average is the middle value in the list of numbers,
so if we have 7 numbers such as in (4,4,4,10,15,15,112), the median will be the 4th number (10).

Mode: The mode average is the number appearing the most times.
in (4,4,4,10,15,15,112) the number 15 appears twice, and the number 4 appears three times.
Therefore the mode of (4,4,4,10,15,15,112) is 4.

**Actionable Insight**: An insight derived from company data, campaign performance, product performance or other which directs to actions which we should start doing from now on.
