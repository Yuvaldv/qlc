## Recognizing Disruptive Technology
### How Kodak invented the camera that would destroy it
<img src="/assets/blockchain/KodakLogo.png" height="96" width="96">

One of the most famous case studies teaching lack of foresight when it comes to disruptive technologies involves the infamous demise of the camera and film company Kodak.

Despite the fact that the first digital camera was invented in Kodak's own R&D department by [Steve Sasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Sasson) in 1975, and when the [first consumer product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mavica) hit the market in 1981, Kodak's own Head of Market Intelligence handed in a fairly accurate report predicting the adoption-rate of digital cameras, Kodak's management failed to see digital cameras as disruptive technology for two decades ending up with the company filing for bankruptcy in 2012.

### How Nokia lacked initiative to participate in the Smartphone battles
<img src="/assets/blockchain/nokia-logo.png" height="96" width="96">

Nokia, a Finnish company which started out in the pulp mill industry back in 1865, in 1960 Nokia first ventured into the telecommunication markets going from military, government and enterprise markets slowly towards consumer markets with car-phones and personal computers, until 1987 when they rolled out the first product that can truly be described as a mobile phone, the Mobira Cityman 900.

While we won't go into the inner workings of Nokia's corporate culture & structure, we will establish that it is that same culture which was the main reason for their failure in adopting the innovation of smartphones. The smartphone innovation was foreseen by Nokia's Management as early as 2005, and it was also viewed as an important shift in the market. The problem arose when the top and middle management had to do something at risk of losing their status due to shifting organizational structures.

So it wasn't any lack of foresight as in Kodak's case. It was lack of initiative and fear of internal struggles that brought Nokia to let innovation pass it by.

Nokia's fall from grace teaches us that knowledge isn't enough, you gotta have the guts to do something about it.

### Conclusion
Lack of foresight to recognize disruptive technologies and lack of initiative to move with innovation and not against it can lead even the largest entities to financial decay.
While similar cases such as Blockbuster vs. Netflix, exist and will continue to exist. The case of the Blockchain vs. Bank or Crypto vs. [FIAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) is not the same.
Faithfully a wide range of financial institutions have recognized the disruptive technology that is the blockchain and began to develop and adopt it, even partially. So there are no worries about the blockchain bankrupting the entire banking system.

## History of the Blockchain
The foundations of the blockchain have been conceptualized [as early as 1990](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-38424-3_32.pdf) and refined by Haber and associates [up until 1992](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~bayer/papers/Timestamp_BHS93.pdf).

It wasn't until 2008 when the subject suddenly [re-surfaced](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) by an anonymous alias only known as Satoshi Nakamoto who soon after, released the first version of Bitcoin on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/)  in 2009

The rest, as they say, is history. One of rapid growth in both capital, sustainability, use cases and number of players.

## Benefits of Blockchain
By solving the double-spending problem in an effective and autonomous manner and not requiring intermediaries to validate the transfer of assets or currency, the blockchain has given us the potential to significantly lower the costs of transactions of all kinds - logistic, financial, legal and more. with game-changing consequences to costs of transferring goods, services, assets, and currency across the globe.

The blockchain also offers the possibility of contracts that are autonomously enforceable called Smart Contracts, these contracts manage the transfer of funds and the conditions of ownership without requiring intermediaries such as courts of law.

Using the [IPFS protocol](https://ipfs.io/) on top of a blockchain solves the short life-span of online web pages enabling the longevity if information through a method of storing & sharing rich media websites. In other words, this gives the potential for a decentralized and uncensorable web including file sharing.

## Market Adoption of Blockchain Technologies.
Blockchain's popularity is on the rise, from consumer-facing [money-management](https://mco.crypto.com) and [trading  solutions](https://www.circle.com), to [enterprise compliance & regulation solutions](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs), [ready to use blockchain infastructures](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/orbs) and even [attempting to solve the major ownership problem of DNA samples] (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/project-shivom), Great, but how much money does this a niche startup industry actually bring?

Well, so far the blockchain startups have gained a rapid growth in [VC funds headed its way](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/20/with-at-least-1-3-billion-invested-globally-in-2018-vc-funding-for-blockchain-blows-past-2017-totals/), expanding at a median rate of 150% per year since 2012 when it collected 25,000 dollars in VC funding, to 2018 when it collected $1.3B, so far.

Putting startup projects aside, large enterprise corporations are far from being left out in the dust.
[JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/blockchain) is working on numerous projects along with [Quorom](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum) which it launched earlier this year.

[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/blockchain/index.html), [SAP](https://www.sap.com/products/leonardo.html), [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/blockchain-workbench/), and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/blockchain/) have all launched several blockchain solutions covering a range of market verticals and use cases.

When thinking of the possibilities of this solution outside the standard use-case of a private currency, this solution to the double-spending problem solves major issues in business, such as logistics management, contract management, copyright management; as well as government such as identity management, asset management, government budget management, public transport and more. all of these have their own set of use cases, for example, identity management can be used for cross-service identity management and individual identification and even allow for online voting, with minimal concerns to identity theft.

Let's take a look at some of the ways the blockchain is being utilized today and might be utilized in the coming future

### Case Studies & Use Cases

In what may well be a state-wide embarrassment Russia should soon launch it's [CryptoRuble](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockshow-announces-blockshow-americas-2018-conference-in-las-vegas-august-20-21) come 2019 on its own governmental blockchain infrastructure.
