## Buffer on Facebook

[Buffer is a social media scheduling platform](https://buffer.com/). Throughout 2016-17 they changed their Facebook Growth strategy which previously included 3-5 posts per day, highly emphasizing on organic content and marketing posts aiming to drive organic traffic to their website and blog. At this time each blog post was published to Facebook indiscriminately.

After several experimentations [Buffer](https://www.facebook.com/bufferapp/) came out with a pivotal shift from the previous strategy, they minimized their posting schedule to include only 1-2 posts per day focusing more on quality and content relevance to their FB audience, rather than quantity. Along with their organic content, they started including content curated from other brands as well as entertaining images targeting their audience. Their articulated new strategy named Edu-tainment focuses on educational, thoughtful and valuable insights as well as funny, relatable and entertaining content. If a piece of content can relate to both these fields simultaneously all the better, though being affiliated with just one side of the coin works just as well.

With their new minimized strategy Buffer managed to increase both their reach and user engagement on Facebook by 3X.
