The following templates aim at helping you manage your copy guidelines, content-segments, schedule & backlog. It's highly advised to modify the template for the needs of your team and project in contrast to using it as is.

The copy guidelines are rather robust specifying exactly how writers should engage their audience in their content. Make sure to modify it or rebuild it from scratch to accurately portray your brand and the voice it carries with it.

The Content Marketing template contains the Segments tab, which should be filled with your desired content segments along with the approximate word count, CTA & Distribution platforms for each. A Schedule tab which should be used to place your different content segments in a monthly schedule as well as populates your distribution schedule per platform. The Creation KPI tracking which tracks your creation process and attention to deadlines, and a tab containing examples of how to calculate growth using excel. Make sure to modify this file per your own needs and share it with your team so youâ€™re all working on the same document.
