## Distribution Platforms

Your chosen content distribution platforms depend highly on your target audience and product niche, you should make sure to find those platforms that are accommodating to your content, already populating your target audience and your competition.

### B2B Distribution Platforms

**LinkedIn** - LinkedIn is a social media platform aimed at business professionals. It has recently published a highly engaging  feature of article publishing aimed at the business community

**Medium** - Medium is a blogging platform that was initially occupied by the SF tech community which is still holding strong to this day.

**SlideShare** - SlideShare is Linkedin’s presentation sharing platform.

### B2C Distribution Platforms

**Facebook** - Facebook's reach is beyond immense, though your ability as an organic publisher to target your audience is now rather limited since the removal of the *Preferred Audience* feature.

**Twitter** - Twitter's 280 Character limit gives you lot’s of room to effectively link to your article and effectively engage your audience.

### Organic Blogging

**Guest-blogging** - Writing a guest-article for an industry-related blog has immense value in a great many different respects, from SEO, to networking, to even customer acquisition. Collaborating with other industry publishers is more than a good idea, though take into consideration that you’ll need prior content to effectively create these kinds of collaboration.

**Organic Blog** - No matter on which platforms you're running your stories, publishing them on your organic blog as well is essential to your brand’s success in both B2B and B2C spaces. Without it, your content loses most of its original value.

## Content Optimizations

Now that a week or two had passed and we’ve been publishing several articles per content-segment, We should take a realistic look at how our content is performing out in the market against our pre-defined OKRs.

Since we’re working on a new blog with no prior performance-data, our first look will establish our performance baseline, from there we’ll aim for a significant and exponential growth, and judge both our performance and the effectivity of our OKRs which we might want to modify after real-world experiences.

We’ll be measuring the baseline and growth of our content OKRs

- **Per content segment**, establishing a baseline and growth rate per article-type.
- **Per timeframe**, establishing our growth rate per day, week and month.
- **Per article**, examining how each article we published is performing. at times old articles might still be bringing-in traffic while new and less engaging articles underperform.
- **Per distribution platform** - sometimes we’ll publish the same article on several platforms, results are sure to be different and will direct us towards those platforms that will work and are working best for our brand.
- **Per engagement type** - some user-engagements are more valuable and others less. A share, comment or page-like might be more valuable than a simple like on an article-piece.
