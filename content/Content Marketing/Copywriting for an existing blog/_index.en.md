## Introduction

The main challenge in developing a content strategy and copywriting and for an already existing blog is in properly defining what was, what we’re pivoting to and why. Many times previous content-strategy documents such as OKRs, brand-guidelines, etc. will be nonexistent, which will compel us to recreate them from the published content, then understand why we are pivoting to something different than what was, and then create our new strategy to solve those specific points of under-performance.

## Defining our Goal & OKRs

We’ll start by defining the goal we want to accomplish with our new content strategy and execution, as well as the desired objectives and metrics (KPIs) that will measure our success. These should be detached from any previous endeavors and will only define what we want to achieve presently.

## Inspecting our Previous Metric Baselines

Only once we’ve defined the OKRs for our new content strategy will we begin inspecting the metric-baselines our blog had previously achieved per those KPIs specifically. These baselines will act as the frame of reference against which we’ll be measuring our future performance and effectiveness.

## Formulating our Old Brand Identity

Before we even begin structuring our new brand guidelines, we’ll make sure to meticulously formulate exactly what our previous brand-voice looked like, when a brand-guidelines document is nonexistent, which will often be the case, we’ll inspect our previous articles and derive the guidelines from those, creating a new document for the old brand guidelines.

## Structuring our New Brand Identity

Only after we’ve formulated exactly how our previous brand identity was, we’ll begin ideating exactly what specific guidelines we’d want to either definitively modify, or test and optimize for establishing our new brand-voice

## Following Through

From here on we’ll follow-through by establishing our content segments, roadmap, and backlog as well as write our content-pieces in very much the same fashion as previously mentioned.
