            <h1>Terms &amp; Concepts</h1>
          

        


<p>It&rsquo;s time to understand all the terms and concepts we&rsquo;ve used so far an more.
So, let’s get started!</p>

<p><strong>Consumer</strong>: A consumer is a private individual, not an organization or a business.</p>

<p><strong>SMB</strong>: Small and Medium Business (SMBs) are local business such as restaurants, hotels, with a limited amount of employees. While startups are similar to SMBs in amount of employees they are very different than them in terms of revenue and business models and are therefore categorized separately from SMBs.</p>

<p><strong>Startup</strong>: A Startup is a human institution, a company, or a team designed to create a new
product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty such as an unknown market, uneducated market, first product of it&rsquo;s kind and more..</p>

<p><strong>MLE</strong>: Medium and Large Enterprises refers to companies with 100+ employees (medium) or with 500+ employee (large). Examples of enterprises would be Adobe, Microsoft, Salesforce, Intel and more.</p>

<p><strong>Consumer Facing</strong>: Consumer facing products and services target private individuals. Facebook, SnapChat, Tinder, Spotify are all consumer facing products</p>

<p><strong>Business Facing</strong>: Business facing products and services target SMBs, Startups or MLEs. SalesForce, LinkedIn Recruiter, Slack, Facebook Workplace are all business facing products</p>

<p><strong>Enterprise Facing</strong>: The reason Enterprise is separated from business facing, is due to the fact that the sales process is a lot longer filled with much more friction for enterprise companies when in startups or SMBs in barely exists. Creating Enterprise facing products entails the understanding the getting the first customer will take a while, Vs. a consumer facing product which can possibly go viral in days.</p>

<p><strong>CEO</strong>: The Chief Executive Officer is the leader of the entire company, he carries his attention wherever it&rsquo;s needed most as well as oversee the entire company.</p>

<p><strong>CMO</strong>: The Chief Marketing Officer manages the entire marketing efforts and employees that manage them.</p>

<p><strong>CTO</strong>: The Chief Technology Officer managers the entire developer team, project managers, and IT department.</p>

<p><strong>COO</strong>: The Chief Operations Manager oversees the entire company and is responsible for the entire operations of the company, including office management, supplier management, resource management(cars, flights, etc), making sure each all departments have the personnel they need and more.</p>

<p><strong>CFO</strong>: The Chief Financial Officer oversees the company spending, burn, revenue, taxes, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Burn rate</strong>: The burn rate is a measure of how long a company can keep operating until it has to seek more financing. Burn rate is normally used to describe the rate at which a new company is spending its venture capital to finance overhead before generating positive cash flow from operations; it is a measure of negative cash flow. Burn rate is usually quoted in terms of cash spent per month.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding</strong>: Refers to a grace period of learning, and depends highly on context. When speaking of employee it refers to the time it takes for the employee to learn the ropes and start being productive. When speaking of user onboarding refers to a tutorial or teaching session at the beginning of using the product.</p>

<p><strong>Lead / Prospect</strong>:
a lead is an individual or organization with an interest in what you are selling. The interest is expressed by sharing contact information, like an email, a phone number, or even a social media handle.</p>

<p><strong>Cold Lead</strong> - Is a lead which either hasn&rsquo;t heard of our brand and product or one which just doesn&rsquo;t have us on his mind. Just because a lead is cold, doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can&rsquo;t be nurtured into becoming a paying customer.</p>

<p><strong>Hot Lead</strong> - It is a lead who recently showed interest in our product in one way or another, like leaving his details on our website, for instance.</p>

<p><strong>Customer</strong>: A customer is a person or company who had purchased our product.</p>

<p><strong>Audience Cohort</strong>: Audiences can be segmented or divided to different groups called Cohorts according to models such as the customer lifecycle or by month of registration. Splitting up all our leads into cohorts an looking at their behavior &amp; revenue grants a lot of insight.
Here are two examples of how of segmented cohorts of the target audience:</p>

<p>By behavior and converison rate:

For instance an objective would be</p>

<ul>
<li>Aquire new customers through social media</li>
</ul>

<p>And the KPIs i.e Key Results, coupled with it would be</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Average Post CTR on Facebook</p></li>

<li><p>Average conversion rate from Facebook visitors</p></li>

<li><p>etc.</p></li>

<p><strong>Conversion Rate</strong>: The percentage of people who complete your campaign goal such as purchase, registration, inquiry or other. If your conversion rate is low, it’s time to optimize your landing page or website.</p>

<p><strong>SEO</strong> : Search engine optimization refers to the work to elevate your website on search results.</p>

<p><strong>SEM</strong> : Literally translates to Search Engine Marketing, refers to ad placement purchases on search engines.</p>

<p><strong>CPM</strong>: Cost per Impression (CPM) is an ad payment model where you pay for every 1000 impressions i.e views of your ad. This is in contrast to the various types of pay-for-performance advertising, whereby payment is only triggered by a mutually agreed upon activity (i.e. click-through, lead, sale).</p>

<p><strong>CPC</strong> Cost per Click (CPC) is an ad payment model where you pay for each click on your ad instead of just the ad being viewed. If the ad is presented to a user and isn&rsquo;t clicked, you don&rsquo;t pay.</p>

<p><strong>CPL</strong>: Cost per Lead (CPL) is an ad payment model where you pay for each qualified lead, meaning not only was the ad presented to the user, and not only did he click it, he also filled out a form or clicked a CTA which qualifies him as a lead.</p>

<p><strong>CPA</strong>: Cost per Action (CPA) refers to the total cost of converting someone wherein action generally refers to a financial transaction or a purchase engaged by the user. Cost Per Acquisition is the ultimate metric for any marketing department because you don’t want to spend more money to convert a customer than they’re worth.</p>

<p><strong>CPI</strong>: Cost per Install (CPI) is an ad payment model where you pay for each app install.</p>

<p><strong>Referral Rate</strong>: Your referral rate is the volume of referred purchases as a % of your total purchases. So a 1% referral rate means that 1 in 100 purchases at your store happen through your referral program. An Advocate shares a referral link (typically via social media, email or IM).</p>

<p><strong>Growth</strong>: Our growth indicates how our KPI is measuring up in relation to past results per the same KPI.</p>

<p>Specific growth and Average (mean) growth may be calculated via these two simple formulas</p>

<p>$specificGrowth = \frac{present - past}{past}$
Calculates growth between two timestamps</p>

<p>$avgGrowth = (\frac{recentTime}{firstTime})^\frac{1}{n} -1 $
Calculates average growth between <em>n</em> timestamps</p>

<p><strong>Rate</strong>: The rate of any KPI such as Churn Rate, Growth Rate, Conversion Rate etc. how our KPIs performance is measuring up in relation to the overall audience it was exposed to.</p>

<p>If for instance we got an average of 20 post likes per day, a month ago, where our entire page followers were 200, and today we have an average of 40 post likes per day with a following of 1200 users, it’s safe to say our user engagement is on the decline.</p>

<p>Rate is simply calculated as such:
$\frac{metric}{audience}$</p>

<p><strong>Avearge</strong>: While working in digital marketing it&rsquo;s important to differentiate and understand the different kind&rsquo;s of averages: <strong>Mean, Median, Mode, and Range</strong></p>

<p>Mean: The mean average is what your used to&ndash; taking the overall sum and dividing by the number of numbers included.</p>

<p>$ MeanAvg = \frac{Sum}{#ofNumbers} $
$ MeanAvg(4,4,4,10,15,15,112) = \frac{164}{7} = 23.43 $</p>

<p>Median: The median average is the middle value in the list of numbers,
so if we have 7 numbers such as in (4,4,4,10,15,15,112), the median will be the 4th number (10).</p>

<p>Mode: The mode average is the number appearing the most times.
in (4,4,4,10,15,15,112) the number 15 appears twice, and the number 4 appears three times.
Therefore the mode of (4,4,4,10,15,15,112) is 4.</p>

<p><strong>Actionable Insight</strong>: An insight derived from company data, campaign performance, product performance or other which directs to actions which we should start doing from now on.</p>
