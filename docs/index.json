	"content": " Before rushing to write our content it’s important to level-the-playing-field across our entire team by properly defining the strategy for content creation which should include a pre-defined goal, it’s objectives and measurable metrics, the content-types we’ll be creating, the roadmap and schedule and of course our brand identity and voice.\nDefining a Goal Our goal defines what we aim to achieve via the content we’re creating i.e what will be our endgame. Goals generally fall under one of these categories:\nAcquisition, Engagement, Branding, SEO Acquisition refers to visitors clicking through the article via a call-to-action (CTA) and registering to our service or purchasing a product. it’s generally measured via two different metrics: the click-through-rate (CTR) indicating how many visitors click through the article via the CTA out of all visitors landing on the article page; And Conversion rate indicating how many visitors register to our service or buy a product out of all visitors landing on the article-page.\nEngagement refers to visitors staying on our website and reading our articles, it is measured through metrics such as Session duration- the average time visitors tend to stay on our website, pages-per-session, time-on-page indicating at each article’s engagement level, and bounce-rate indicating at how many visitors leave after visiting just one page.\nBranding refers to visitors sharing and engaging with our content on our own website as well as available distribution platforms and is measured by number of sessions and unique visitors indicating at a growth in brand-reach, as well as user engagements such as comments, shares, likes, retweets etc. on the various distribution platforms we’ve published to.\nSearch Engine Optimization i.e SEO refers to our domains ranking in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) per specific keywords. While SEO-work is widely based on content creation, there’s a lot more to it, so we’ll be touching this specific goal separately at the bottom of the course.\nDefining OKRs Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a set of objectives accompanied by metrics often called Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure their empirical success, e.g:\nBranding and Awareness\n- Visits - Unique Visitors - Engagements e.g likes, shares, retweets, etc. - Referral Links  Engagement\n- Session duration - Pages per session - Time on Page - Bounce Rate - Comments  Lead Generation\n- Form Completions - Email Subscriptions - Blog Subscriptions  Acquisition \u0026amp; Conversion\n- CTR - Conversion rate - Sales rate - Online / Offline - Sales Volume - Upsell / Cross-sale rate  Retention\n- Product Retention Rate - Retention Sales rate - Retention Sales Volume - Content Retention Rate - Existing-User Engagement  The above lists various different goals for the sake of example only, it’s important to set the specific goal and point-of-focus for your content.\nDefining Content Segments After we’ve got a well-defined purpose, goals, objectives and metrics to measure the success of our content, the initial phase of content development will be ideating the article-types we’ll want to be producing. Optimally at this stage, we’ll also decide on the approx. word-count and the call-to-action (CTA) per content-segment which will define the objective the segment serves as well as guide the writing towards an end result.\nYou may also think of these as article-series, For instance:\n   Content Segment Word Length Call to Action     Positive product case studies 500 words Register Now   Positive/negative industry case studies 500w Read More (Pos)Register Now (Neg)   Team-member personal story 300w Read More   Product-based and how-to’s 300w Read More   Market Research 500w Read More   Testimonials 300w Register Now   How-it-works 750w Register Now (basic features)Purchase Now (premium features)   Lists 300w Read More   Reviews 300w Register Now   Opinion 500w Read More   KOL (key opinion leader) Interview 1000w Read More    Once we’ve got our content segments all lined up, our content creation and ideation process should run much smoother.\nScheduling a Content Roadmap Once we’ve mapped out the types of content we’ll be creating it’s time to ideate our initial article topics and develop a weekly scheduled framework for our article postings.\nSchedule A recurring weekly schedule of articles to-be-posted by type is essential for a fluent and predictable workflow\nBacklog Our backlog is a list of all our ideas for new articles, it should contain URLs for inspiration, possible article titles, their article-type according to our pre-defined content segments, the approx. word-count for the article, and the article CTA.\nDefining our Brand Identity Alright, so now we’re well established on the content workflow, schedule, and backlog, but we still need a unified voice across our entire team, we need a brand to follow.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a great example of how our copy-guidelines might look like. While this example is of high-detail and 8 pages long, your copy-guidelines can be much shorter and generalized.\nThe important thing being that it’s coherent in making all our articles across our entire content-writing team have a unified voice and personality adhering to our brand’s message and mission.\nCase Studies The fact is theory alone just won’t do in getting you closer towards project and professional success. The following real-world stories featuring brands traversing the thickets of organic content marketing are an integral part of your learning process towards becoming an industry practitioner.\nMake sure to read and understand each brand’s journey through thick and thin as well as visit their homepage \u0026amp; blogs, tracking back their post history and researching them via SimiliarWeb in order to explore and understand first hand exactly how they managed to attain their current market positioning.\nGroove tells the story of how they remodeled their failing content strategy. Groove is a helpdesk ticketing platform, in this case study, Groove’s Founder \u0026amp; CEO, A. Turnbull tells the story of how they pivoted their entire content marketing strategy from focusing on nice looking, industry-related content to shifting in focus to customer real-world pain-points, resulting in exponential growth.\nRead the full case study on Groove\nKevin D.

In 2011 they launched a product named Creo which provided a CAD solution comparable to SolidWorks or AutoCAD. In order to engage this previously untapped audience they started a specialized blog aligned with a strategy to engage CAD-industry problems without focusing the selling-points of their Creo solution. Within four short months, they managed to surpass the 100,000 blog visitors, with 70% of the traffic being first-time visitors.\nRead the full case study here\nGroove explores how story-driven content increases user-engagement.

	"content": " Introduction It’s important to note that you will not be fed with a silver spoon, neither while learning from our curriculums nor while participating in our projects.\nYou are about to embark on your very first professional experience in the global tech industry. Short as it may seem, it may offer immense value. from portfolio-ready materials you’ll be creating, to real-world understanding of * behavioral economics*, 2017 Nobel prize winning subject.\nWhile our curriculums will onboard you to professional terminology \u0026amp; role-fundamentals, you are expected to learn on your feet, aim for real-world results \u0026amp; research continuously, just like any other employee working the digital industry.\nThis could be the starting point of your career, the initial experience you\u0026rsquo;ll acquire towards attaining a junior position from which you will grow. But only if you play it right.\nPreliminary Work Before starting work on your project, it\u0026rsquo;s well advised to get to know the brand and market you\u0026rsquo;ll be operating in.\n Keep work environments handy - bookmark your project dashboard resource library, shared documents, trello boards, and all other work tools \u0026amp; channels to your bookmarks bar. Check our glossary for reference on the language and terminology of the digital landscape so as to understand what your peers and managers are asking. Search and review your brand website on SimilarWeb and Wappalyzer, Search for your competition on google using your brand keywords, pinpoint 3-5 main competitors, in terms of traffic using SimilarWeb. Research your competitors as relating to your project-scope - whether it’s their social presence, email marketing automation flow, sales pitch, etc. Make sure to gather some insight into how your competitors operate beforehand. Review the curriculum again focusing on the parts most relevant for your specific project.  Project Communications Ping your Project Mentor (PM) at project initiation to send you access to the tools and platforms your team will be working with, log in to all the platforms and check that you’re all set up for working on the project, ask your PM to resolve any log-in or credential problems you\u0026rsquo;re encountering.\nThroughout each day as you work on the project, stay attentive to your communication and task platforms for any project related chatter, insights, progress, and dilemmas\u0026ndash; these are the project’s main line of communications.\nIf on some days you happen to be preoccupied with unrelated issues, which is quite alright, make sure to still be attentive to your project\u0026rsquo;s communications and be responsive throughout the day via mobile or desktop.\nAttend weekly face-to-face, these will be scheduled by your PM and conducted via video chat platforms such as slack, zoom or skype. It’s important to understand that these meetings are only there for a broad review of the team and project progress, while the actual project management is conducted asynchronously via the communication and project management platforms.\nIf you happen to miss a face-to-face meeting, make sure to let your PM know before the meeting, review the meeting summary and add your own notes after.\nProject Operations   Make sure to keep your deliverables in an immediately shareable format, preferably google docs where live-collaboration is unmatchable. This serves both cross-team-pollination, peer-review, and PM review as asynchronous processes.\nValidated learning and results-driven orientation While your project Objectives and Key-Performance-Indicators (KPIs) will be defined by your PM, in order to maximize the added value you’ll gain from the project it’s important to understand the following:\nBeing able to say you worked on a project p for company c just isn’t enough for your long-term success nor your current HR positioning.\nOn the other hand, being able to say that while working on project p for company c you’ve learned of behaviour b regarding audience a through a validated learning process and that you achieved an x,y,z elevation in KPIs k, p, i resulting in g overall growth, sounds like you’re hired.\nOur Goal Our aim here at QLC is for you to utilize the experience, knowledge, and deliverables achieved via this project to attain and secure your next, and possibly first position in the global tech-industry, only through your successful assimilation in this job market do we at QLC achieve success.\nWe will not be issuing rubber-stamp certifications, thus your commitment to the project throughout, as well as delivery on milestones is imperative to your certification and eventual success.\nDo Good, Good Luck,\nQLC.\n"

	"content": " Preface SEO work relies heavily on content and aims to elevate our websites ranking on search results. Generally speaking, our content is indexed by the search engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, etc.) and ranked via their internal algorithms per keyword and search-term. Thus when a user searches or queries the search-engine, the results presented to him in the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), relies on how each website was indexed and it’s ranking for that particular search term. The website ranking is dependent on the number of backlinks it’s getting, the web-ranking of those backlinkers, once again per search-term, the relevance of our website content to those search-terms, our sites technical performance, speed, responsiveness, accommodation for mobile users, and more. So while content is indeed the base upon which SEO work stands on, there’s definitely a lot more to it.\nIn this guide we\u0026rsquo;ll offer several free tools for SEO work, it should be noted that these free tools can only go so far, and having an arsenal of paid tools such as Moz and SEMRush gives out a huge advantage in managing and strategizing SEO work.\nSEO OKRs Website Search-Ranking  Domain Rank for main converting keywords - Measure via SmallSEOTools Domain Rank for secondary benchmark keywords Majestic (Citation Flow, Trust Flow and Trust \u0026amp; Citation Balance) Moz Opensite Explorer (Domain Authority, Page Authority and Spam Score) WOT (Rating)  Organic traffic Tracked via Google Analytics Under acquisition -\u0026gt; search console\nUnder Queries  Organic traffic per keyword Non-branded search traffic Organic Impressions Organic Click-through-rate (CTR)  Others  Number of pages generating traffic - Under landing pages Traffic from targeted geo-locations - Under countries Organic conversion rate - You’ll need to set a goal in GA and view the report with an audience segment for organic traffic.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Often referred to as the sales funnel, or buyer’s journey, the customer’s life cycle describes the successful pathway our customers take towards becoming satisfied, paying, long-term customers.\nUsing the customer life-cycle as a marketing framework gives us a unique edge in planning \u0026amp; assessing our marketing performance – we can identify friction points in which customers tend to churn, define the goals our marketing campaigns aim to accomplish, establish effective persona concerns and more.\nEach of our campaigns and endeavors in social media, email, content marketing and ad-buying are part of the customer lifecycle and serve a specific purpose in pushing prospects further down the funnel.\nWe’re going to review three different frameworks for describing the customer lifecycle.\n McKinsey’s Customer Journey which describes the customer’s point of view The Inbound Methodology which describes our point of view as digital marketers And Pirate Metrics which provides an analytical framework for measuring success  Mckinsey’s customer journey This framework describes how a potential customer, otherwise known as a lead or a prospect, might view us among our competition as well as all other content they consume.\nAt first, they become aware that we exist through our brand publicity efforts, such as ad-buying, posts on social media, advancing our position on search engines, and creating articles, images and videos.\nAt times you’ll see a stage called Familiarity as the next stage in which the lead will become familiar with our brand and product and recognize it from across the rest of the content that is directed at them.\nOnce they are aware of our solutions, they might consider us as a provider for solving their problem or requirement. This, of course, includes beta testing \u0026amp; free-trials.\nIn the next stage, the lead would purchase and use our product for the very first time.\nAfter which they’ll come back \u0026amp; keep using it, hopefully, on a regular basis, leading to customer retention.\nThe now satisfied customer, would then recommend our product to acquaintances, bringing us fresh leads. This is the final stage which triggers a repeat of the previously mentioned customer retention process.\nThis is of course a funnel, as we progress down this funnel throughout the different stages\u0026ndash; awareness, consideration, purchase, retention and advocacy, we’ll have less and less leads or customers than we had in the previous stage, In other words, each stage contains a percentage of its predecessor.\nThe Inbound Methodology The inbound methodology describes, how we as digital marketers attempt to impact strangers into becoming paying customers.\nAttracting strangers to visit our brand presence through social media, search engines, email and cold calls Converting visitors into giving us their details e.g full name, email, phone number; and turning them into leads Closing Leads into paying customers And delighting our customer-base into staying as well as referring more traffic to our service\nSo, an office chat regarding the customer lifecycle might look something like this:\n “In the awareness stage we have an overall 23% click-through-rate (CTR) on our social and search presences. However, we’re noticing a lot of friction at the consideration stage. There’s a 75% bounce rate. Only 3% of our visitors are converting into leads but 67% of these leads end up purchasing our product.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So we’re bringing in a lot of prospects, most of which find our product immaterial. But those that do take interest are choosing us instead of our competitors two thirds of the time.”\n\u0026ldquo;We need to refine our approach. It could be that the scope of our product or branding is too narrow and we should revise our marketing language or develop a larger features-set.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It might also be that our organic content is broader than our offering and people are mistaking our value for something else.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should A/B test different solutions via email, social media, and on our website to find exactly what is causing our conversion problem.”\n This is just an example of how the customer lifecycle is incorporated into the daily conversation of digital marketers. Don’t worry if you didn’t get all that, by the time you finish this course everything will be crystal clear.\nPirate Metrics! So, the last two frameworks gave us a way to describe our efforts and our results at each stage of the customer lifecycle in a very broad manner. With pirate metrics, the data concerning each parameter is consistently tracked in order to intuitively identify points of friction, where potential customers will no longer be interested in our product.\nPirate metrics focuses on AARRR metrics\n Acquisition: How do we get strangers to find us?\n Activation: How do our visitors get to have a great first experience?\n Retention: How do we get our users \u0026amp; visitors to keep coming back?\n Referral: How do we get our users to tell others about us?\n Revenue: How do we make money?\n  This is great for executives and analytics professionals to get the entire team to work together towards the same goals in an empiric or measurable way.\nAcquisition includes metrics such as visits to homepage and landing-pages, bounce rate, visitor-session-time, number-pages-viewed-during-session and of course conversion rate.\nActivation is measured by metrics such as registrations, feature usage, user session time, purchases and so on.\nRetention metrics include number of sessions per user per day/week/month, interactions with our brand on social media, email open rate, feature adoption and more, Measured separately for Users and Visitors.\nRevenue includes metrics such as customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, acquisitions per week or month, and more.\nReferral is generally done via cohort analysis of users who referred registered users to our website, with the cohorts being how many users they referred, 1, 2, above 3, etc.\nThe chart below gives out an example of the AARRR framework at work:\n   Stage Metrics Conversion Rate Sample Size     Acquisition Visits (Homepage, Landing pages), Bounce Rate, Visitor-Session-Duration, Visitor-Pages-per-Session 70% 1013 Visitors   Activation Signup, Feedback, Usage 20% 709 Visitors   Retention Visits per day/week/month, email open rate, CTR 45% 141 Users / 432 Visitors   Revenue CAC, LTV, New customers per day/week/month 20% 141 Users   Referral Number of referring customers, average number of referrals per customer, number of customers who made 1 referrals, 2 referrals, 3, 4, 5, etc. 63 Users     "

	"content": " Research Before delving into writing our content-piece we’ll take some time to look through the inspiration articles attached to the article-topic in our backlog, we’ll also search the web for similar content pieces with informative material that will allow us not only to give out reliable information but also enable us to tell a good story and tell it well.\nForming Article Structure After having a well-rounded understanding of our content-piece we’ll start forming the structure of the article. Optimally that would include the topic of every paragraph included in the article, most times though it’ll only include the main titles, subtitles, and bullet-points we’ll want to touch as part of our content-piece.\nContent-Writing Some arts just can’t be taught, this is where all of our infrastructural work mixed with your special brand-of-talent will come into play in creating a grand content-piece of your own making.\nHere’s a segment from John Milne’s \u0026amp; David B. Scott’s essay on The Evolving B2B Publishing Business Model to captivate your inspiration\n Too many, it would seem, are quick to claim that \u0026ldquo;writing is writing.\u0026rdquo; A solid background in B2B editorial will enable one to write compelling ad copy with headlines that will drive sales through the roof. But is it that simple? The skills required to research and write news stories and editorial features are very different from those required to craft compelling and actionable ad copy. Case in point: no Journalism programs include classes in the latter. Regardless, the two schools of the discipline must coexist and respect each other - especially within the small parameters of the B2B community. Effective copy for display B2B advertising will convey an intimate understanding of the market and buyer (reader) needs. It can draw on emotion; be humorous; use facts to assert authority - but in all cases, it is intended to provoke a commercial reaction. While some might argue that this definition is simplistic, for the purposes of this paper it provides a reasonable summary of this one school of the writing craft. This is one of the many reasons why every effort has to be made to incorporate members of the editorial team in the development of sponsor content. Whether it be a news story, a profile, or a feature, B2B editorial content is intended to impart industry-specific material that is unavailable in the popular media in an informed manner that ultimately \u0026ldquo;helps the reader do its job better.\u0026rdquo; Achieving this goal requires a firm working grasp of journalistic principles and skills; immersion in the field served; research know-how; and the ability to keep the reader engaged - over years. These two schools of thought \u0026ldquo;merge\u0026rdquo; when it comes to Content Marketing/Native Advertising/Custom Publishing. Which one prevails or is more important? It is almost impossible to say for in these instances the one can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;exist\u0026rdquo; without the other. The sponsor insists on the authority that comes from the experienced writer with an in-depth knowledge of the field acquired only through years of service. However, the sponsor may also insist on the inclusion of brand attributes or at the very least a reflection of them. For some, striking a balance is difficult. The decision rests with the publisher who should be encouraging editorial staff to acknowledge the current business realities. This does not mean forsaking journalistic integrity. It means building teams who are capable of meeting both reader needs and the needs of advertisers who must engage the audiences that are composed of their customers.`\n Do make sure to adhere to your brand identity and copy-guidelines, aim for the estimated word-count, keep an eye on your CTA and tell a good story well.\nProof-reading After finishing your first draft, have yourself a 15-minute break from the text, and then start reading through it several times, each time focusing on a different aspect of the text.\nTypos \u0026amp; Grammar In today\u0026rsquo;s day-and-age typos have a rather straightforward solution with auto-correct on every word processor. Though they still won’t fix mistakes such as they’re vs. their, its vs. it’s, etc.\nGrammar, on the other hand, could be a challenging aspect of the text, so make sure to practice the following:\n Print out the text onto a proper page, ‘cause searching for these kinds of minute details on a flickering screen just won’t do. Make sure to take a blank page and hide the next line in order to really focus on every line you read in a dedicated manner. Read the text out loud, this is especially effective for grammar mistakes that have a special tendency to not-sit-well on the ear. Finally, use the search function (ctrl+f \u0026amp; ctrl+h) to search for common mistakes you’re likely to make or have found in your last reading.  Copy guidelines In order to verify your current draft is in line with your brand guidelines, I’d suggest the following:\n Print out the copy guidelines and use them as a checklist Use a printed out version of the text in order to comb it more effectively. Read the copy-guidelines once. Read the text once, marking noticeable mistakes but moving on with the reading. Comb the text for mistakes once per guideline, marking each one off.  Thesaurus Using the same exact phrasing multiple times throughout your article could seem tedious to your readers and could possibly damage your user-engagement, conversion, and ultimate goal. So make sure to mix-it-up, within reason, using the thesaurus of your choosing.\n"

	"content": " Researching keywords entail the following:\n Identifying keywords our domain is currently competing in. Identifying keywords we could and should potentially compete for.  Domain Keywords Using Moz Keyword Explorer on our domain, subdomains, and pages we’ll see exactly what keywords are currently indexed for our website, enabling us to create human and index digestible content per those specific keywords.\nRelevant Keywords Using either Google Keyword Planner or Moz Keyword Explorer, we’ll be judging each potential target keyword depending on its volume, difficult and click through rate - Volume indicates at the amount of traffic the keyword is getting - Difficulty or Competition indicates at the amount of brands competing for this keyword and the difficulty we\u0026rsquo;ll face in getting to first page. - The Click-Through-Rate (CTR) indicates at the percentage of clicks on organic results vs. amount of SERPs generated per that keyword .\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll aim to target keywords with high CTR, Low Competition, and a decent amount of traffic.\nAnother tool for measuring keyword viability The Keyword Golden ratio (KGR) is another method for estimating keywords viability by the amount of results for the term and it\u0026rsquo;s overall monthly search volume. The lower the KGR the better.\n$ \\frac{All in Title}{Search Volume} \\le 2.5 $\nYou start by searching for your keyword on google and counting how many results it has in the SERP, this is your \u0026ldquo;All in Title\u0026rdquo; parameter.\nYou can find the monthly search volume via Moz or Google Keyword Explorer\nLatent Semantic Keywords Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is the manner in which search engines contextualize content via closely related words to the search term.\nFor instance when searching for Egypt, how would a search engine know whether to show:\n1. News in Egypt. 2. Egyptian gods \u0026amp; mythology. 3. Ancient Egyptian history. 4. Travel information, flights and accomodation in Egypt. 5. Shops in Egypt for bicycles, cell phones, laptops, pet food, etc.  With LSIs such as synonyms, names, descriptions, etc. the search engine recognizes the context of how the page relates to the search term of \u0026lsquo;egypt\u0026rsquo;.\nThus, When we\u0026rsquo;re targeting relevant keywords in our SEO articles our content will not be crammed by our main target keyword, like in the old days (~late 90s), instead we\u0026rsquo;ll be using LSI optimized content along with main keywords for maximum SERP results.\nLSIs can be found at the bottom of the google search page, search for other relevant terms to collect an array of LSI to use in your content.\nLongtail Keywords Often times, when we’re just starting out with our content creation, the viability of high traffic keywords is practically non-existent, and our attempt to compete in those will just leave us in despair when there are no results after six and more weeks. For that reason, it’s best to target longtail keywords when starting out, i.e very specific search terms with 3+ words, and very low ranking competition. Once we start winning those niche terms, we’ll be able to better compete for high traffic keywords.\nLongtail keywords are phrases that comprise of 3-5 words that describe what you are trying to promote. Often times, when we’re just starting out with our content creation, viability of high traffic keywords is practically non-existent, and our attempt to compete in those will just leave us in despair when there are no results after six and more weeks. For that reason it’s best to target longtail keywords when starting out, highly specific multi-word phrases tend to be far easier to rank well for the more generic single key word or double keyword phrases. For instance, very specific search terms with 3+ words, and very low ranking competition. Once we start winning those niche terms, we’ll be able to better compete for high traffic keywords.\nFortunately, Google likes sites that have more pages as it makes the site look more substantial, more natural, and even more real in the eyes of the world\u0026rsquo;s most popular search engine. Thus, make sure that every page has the unique words that emphasize your offering by using longtail keywords that you chose for each specific page. Therefore, instead of focusing on just two or three highly competitive general keywords, target the dozens or even hundreds of easy-to-rank-for long tail keywords. However, if you target phrases which are too specific, you might not get enough traffic to sustain your business.\nIn conclusion, there are two components that your website needs to have : - a few pages sending you large amounts of less targeted traffic; - a large number of pages with each sending you small amounts of highly targeted traffic.\nKeywords Research Sources Reddit Use Reddit for keywords researching as internet users discuss every topic in this community and the results might surprise us. Firstly, we search for topics that are relevant to our keywords and head over to that community; OR find threads about our topic in search results as people tend to ask a lot of questions. Secondly, scan the threads for potential key words which appear iteratively.

	"content": " With the world of digital marketing evolving every day, new skills and strategies are required to keep up with the challenges. Digital Marketing, as we said, helps us reach out to potential customers, convert them into regular customers and help them succeed with using our product. For this, we divide the customer lifecycle into phases. Each phase of the funnel is equipped with strategies to attract leads towards our brand, these strategies move the needle in our overall journey towards growth. Each role specializes in helping create and execute these strategies.\nLet’s take a look at some of these digital marketing roles\nContent Marketer A word we often see associated with marketing is communication. A Content Marketer helps create a unique story, and content experience for the audience using a mix of data, research and brand requirements. The Content marketer strategizes and moderates the content marketing strategies aimed at acquisition, engagement retention and more. With the help of content creators\u0026ndash; writers, podcasters, videographers, the content marketer plans and executes the different content pieces that will take part in each overall strategy as well as optimizes their components - title, structure, length, overall quality, for maximum performance according to the Key Performance Indicators (KPI\u0026rsquo;s) established in the initial strategy, he also modifies each strategy in itself according to real world lessons learned throughout it\u0026rsquo;s execution as well as works on the content for the homepage, landing pages and other website content.\nSo with the help of his content creators as well as the designer, the content marketer essentially enables the work of the email marketer, social media manager, media buyer and SEO manager by creating content that fits each stage of the customer lifecycle.\nSEO Manager One of the key players in elevating our brand’s web presence is the SEO Manager who manages our website\u0026rsquo;s organic - meaning unpaid - presence on search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, etc. Their day to day responsibilities include researching keywords on which we could viably compete, creating articles targeting those keywords, organizing the website in a proper manner for search engines to index, reviewing the technical setup of the website making sure it is fit with search engine requirements, and, most importantly, collecting outside links, often called backlinks, to our articles and website. So basically, the SEO manager helps in growing the brand and helping in expanding its reach through organic search results and may also take part in elevating results on app stores (ASO) and video platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo\nThe SEO manager works closely with the content marketing team to create articles that fit into his SEO strategy and would benefit our position on search engines.\nMedia Buyer \u0026amp; Affiliate Managers You’d have often noticed paid ads appearing on Google when you are looking for results on a certain keyword, or while browsing social media or playing a mobile game. These ads have been purchased by a brands from across the globe depending on your keywords, demographics, interests and more in order to publicize their service or product. The Media Buyer, who\u0026rsquo;s often referred to as an Ad-Buyer, PPC manager, or SEM manager for those who focus solely on search engines, work towards buying digital ad space with the highest possible Return-on-Investment (ROI) in regards to the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).\nMedia buyers work closely with the designer, social media manager, SEO manager, and content manager the best campaigns in terms of conversion rate and click-through-rate (CTR).\nAffiliate managers on the other hand purchase their leads from other advertisers, called affiliates, who run their own funnels while trying to achieve the same result of optimal ROI and conversion rates.\nSocial Media Marketer Most of us are regular social media users. Often, we come across new brands or discover an article while browsing social media. This happens, thanks to the efforts that businesses put into social media marketing.\nSMM taps into the power of social media platforms and websites to promote our products and services. The Social Media Manager devises social media strategies to reach and engage the target audience. Typically the manager spearheads publishing and managing original, high quality multimedia content and campaigns on a variety of social platforms in order to help the brand or business grow. Their day-to-day activities also include responding to social comments, initiating conversations on different groups and pages, publishing content, tracking the KPIs of published content and optimizing future content to best match the engagements of the target audience throughout the customer lifecycle. The Social media manager works closely with the designer and content manager.\nEmail Marketer Though Social Media Marketing seems to be the trending channel of customer acquisition nowadays, email marketing surprisingly averages at 174% the conversion rate of SMM and has consistently kept its stand with the highest Return-on-Investment (ROI) averaging at 4400% which translates to an approximate $44 revenue for every dollar spent. An Email Marketer segments the target audience to different cohorts according to stages in the customer lifecycle and more, he creates email strategies for acquisition, retention, engagement and more. Email marketers work working closely with the designer, content marketer and sales and customer success teams.\nPR Specialists PR specialists book spots on TV shows, Radio shows, magazines, and guest blogs in order to promote the media coverage of the brand and product. They also help place strategic advertisements o promote the brand and reach the target audience through hoardings and mediums like websites, blogs, social media platforms, digital magazines, and any other digital properties.\nMarketing-Adjacent roles While all the roles we\u0026rsquo;ve reviewed answer to the company CMO, Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at several roles which don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily exist within companies marketing departments but are adjacent and work with that department.\nData Analytics Professionals The roles we have discussed so far help in creating great content and disseminating it amongst our customers. In order to understand how each of our efforts translate to reaching our goals, we depend upon the power of Data Analytics. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at several roles engaged in analyzing data with the aim of achieving actionable insights around the business.\nUX Researcher UX researchers, brand \u0026amp; product managers define, engage in conversion rate optimization, they analyze \u0026amp; interpret data related to their user’s engagement with the product, its funnels \u0026amp; landing pages in an attempt to identify and remove user-friction as well as validate or disprove new feature ideas and UX hypotheses.\nThey use such tools as Mixpanel, Google Analytics, KissMetrics and HotJar for UX analytics; VWO, Optimizely and Google Optimize for optimisation i.e A/B testing; and SimilarWeb, CrunchBase \u0026amp; AppAnnie for market research and positioning.\nThe collaborate closely with the product manager, content manager and designer to see what kind of changes to the user experience will drive engagement the furthest\nBI Analyst Business Intelligence Analysts provide historical, current and predictive view of business operations in order to derive meaningful insights \u0026amp; conclusions to drive the company operations forward.\nThey mainly use SQL \u0026amp; excel, but may also use BI dashboards such as SiSense, SAP, PowerBI, Tableau, etc. The collaborate closely with the all company roles who create data such as the sales and customer success teams, the social media and email marketers and more.\nData Scientist Data Scientists are run hundreds of daily experiments on an ever diminishing scope of interactions to deliver the best possible performance to their users. An example of this would be an offline Backgammon game giving the user an online experience by varied player names such as player0213, Simon, dave, computer, etc. as well as shifting difficulty tied to those names.\nThese mathematical wizards use tools such as Python, R, MatLab Tableau and more. And collaborate closely with the product manager and UX researcher.\nProduct Manager Mostly, in tech companies, it is important for one person to look at the holistic view of the brand and guide individual teams to achieve specific goals. This is where Product managers come into the picture. The product manager and product owner otherwise known as the outbound and inbound product managers (respectively), take the product through it\u0026rsquo;s entire lifecycle from ideation to initial development to maintenance and further feature development with the aspiration of delivering value to the user with ease, achieving profitability, you could say that they are guardians of the product or service that the company is delivering to its customers. They are responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team that is responsible for improving it, They define the strategy, roadmap, UX and features for a product or product line.\nThe collaborate closely with the project manager and software developers, with the designer and of course with the data analytics teams.\nProject Management project managers are the guardians of the software developers. They prioritize and sync tasks across the entire development team at times between 3 and more products and product managers. Right from planning, organizing and managing to executing the project, the project manager’s day-to-day responsibilities are structured towards getting the work done on schedule with a minimum amount of friction and setbacks. They usually act as a liaison between the development team, senior executives and other stakeholders. The usually answer to the CTO of the company.\nBusiness Development and Sales Specialists Business developers approach strategic partners directly using either digital platforms such as LinkedIn or Email, or simply by picking up the phone and cold calling. They work to negotiate and close the terms of collaboration agreements with venture capital firms, investment banks and potential partners. They may work with the product manager and content manager to create sales content and white-papers aimed at leads and partners.\nSales specialists approach potential customers again via digital platforms such as LinkedIn or email as well as cold calling prospects in order to create an interest or follow up on an interest to purchase the product, they negotiate the terms, answer any concerns and give the prospect all the information and attention they need to purchase the product. Some sales positions, mainly in B2B and B2E product require technical knowledge in order to be able to fully discuss the product, it\u0026rsquo;s use cases, feature-set and usage.\nCustomer Success Once a lead becomes a customer, it becomes important to engage them and help them derive the best experience while using our product or service. This is where the Customer Success team otherwise referred to as account managers or customer relations managers, comes into the picture, This team manages the relationship between the brand and its customers with the goal of making the customer as successful as possible, which in turn, maximizes customer retention and lifetime value (LTV).\n"

	"content": " What is a Blockchain? The blockchain is a distributed ledger technology allowing for secure and transparent Peer-to-Peer trust with regards to financial currencies \u0026amp; assets as well as legal agreements, contracts, signatures, terms \u0026amp; conditions.\nWhat are Blocks? A block is a locked \u0026amp; unmodifiable collection of valid transaction records which is sealed by a timestamp of its creation and chained to the previous block. You may think of them as individual pages of a ledger.\nHow are they Chained? Each block hold\u0026rsquo;s a cryptographic-hash of the previous block thus chaining them together. this is somewhat similar to the hash protocol used in Bit-Torrent.\nHow is that secure? By effectively creating Byzantine Fault Tolerance blockchain technologies have ubiquitously created a safe protocol for every use case, given enough scale.\nThere are three parameters for the blockchain\u0026rsquo;s security, one is it\u0026rsquo;s decentralization the other is each block\u0026rsquo;s timestamped seal and the third is the chain itself.\nDistributed \u0026amp; Decentralized - The blockchain is partially or entirely replicated, held and cross-referenced across every one of its miners called peers. thus if I as a hacker wanted to change a record within a block, I would have to do it simultaneously across the all the peers which hold that block.\nThe Chain - Since each block contains the hash of the previous block I, as a hacker, would have to start with the first block and hack my way towards the target block through the entire blockchain and different peers holding them.\nThe Seal - Any modification to the block will change it\u0026rsquo;s timestamped seal. Thus, I, as a hacker, would have to change all the seals, or cryptographic-hash-codes- of every block after my block to correlate with the changes I\u0026rsquo;ve made.\nSo, to put it simply, while a small and relatively centralized blockchain might be somewhat penetrable, and while tools that interact with the blockchain such as wallets, might be vulnerable, A blockchain with enough peers is virtually impenetrable.\nHow is it different from a cryptocurrency? While reading through articles concerning crypto and blockchain you may find that these terms are used interchangeably for the most part and even synonymously for some publications the difference between them is important. While the blockchain is a ledger holding transaction records of assets, cryptocurrencies are but an asset that exists on these blockchains. Read More.\nThe following difference is also imperative to understand, while there can be several blockchains running on different platform providers such as Quorum, IBM Blockchain, or Raiden since all of these platforms make use of Ethereum open-source blockchain technology, all the blockchains that use these platforms as their infrastructure will use Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s protocol.\nIs there one single Blockchain? While someday there may exist a single global blockchain holding all asset types, or more likely interfaces connecting different blockchains, today there are many independent blockchains generally holding a single, or several closely related assets. Each coin has it\u0026rsquo;s own blockchain and there are various, some open-source, architectures to the blockchain technology such as NEM or HyperLedger.\nAre there different types of blockchain? Yes, there certainly are. There are three manners to differentiate blockchains, each with their own set of archetypes\nTransparency \u0026amp; Permission Public Blockchains allow anyone to participate (mine) for the blockchain and the transaction records are completely transparent.\nPrivate Blockchains publish only partial transaction details if any.\nPermissionless Blockchains allow anyone to mine the blockchain, i.e write transaction details to a block.\nPermissioned Blockchains only allow certain users to write transactions or even specific transaction details,\na public permissioned blockchain is often referred to as Consortium or Federated blockchain\nRead More\nBy the underlying infrastructure Just like web development where your tech-stack i.e the programming language and frameworks you use affect how your product behaves and how you maintain it. The same applies to the blockchain, whether you use NEM, Ethereum, Bitcoin or Hyperledger to create your blockchain makes a big difference in how you\u0026rsquo;re solution will handle certain types of interactions.\nBy the different Consensus Protocols - Proof-of-X Relating to the previous point, certain types of blockchains use different consensus protocols to chain a new block.\nPoW (Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin) Proof-of-Work requires a miner whose attempting to chain a new block of transactions to solve a highly complex and CPU intensive puzzle while competing with other users for who\u0026rsquo;ll come first and mine the block and reap some coin.\nThis method is criticized for requiring a vast amount of electricity and CPU power.\nPoS (Ethereum, NXT, PeerCoin, DeCred) Proof-of-Stake uses a miners\u0026rsquo; stake on the coin $$ Stake = \\frac{Users\u0026rsquo; Coins}{All Coins}$$, to help decide who gets to mine it. Generally by an automated voting system.\nProof of Stake is often is used together with proof-of-work by capping a user to mining the transactions amount relative to their stake in the coin.\na Delegated proof of stake allows to group several miners together under one user, and compound their the stake of the coin.\nThis method would mean that miners need to retain a large amount of coin instead of cashing it for profits in order to grow their mining capacity\nPoI (NEM) Proof-of-Importance adds on Proof of Stake the variable of the age of your currency, and how long you\u0026rsquo;ve held it, as well as the number of transactions you made, not only mined.\nRead More\nProof of Space (Chia, SpaceMint, BurstCoin) Sometimes referred to as proof of capacity, proof of space requires a proof that the miner has reserved and designated sufficient amount of RAM and HDD/SSD storage space to handle the transaction, this is done by solving a low-CPU, high storage capacity riddle. This method mainly aims to solve the electricity consumption of mining cryptocurrencies.\nNew consensus protocols are still emerging so keep on eye on the best fit for your solution.\n"

	"content": " Validated Learning Process Validated learning is a process of hypothesizing, measuring, and validating how a certain components of our product best engage our audience. So while we may believe we understand that audience, their real world actions speak louder than our hypothesis.\nEach validated or disproved hypothesis brings us closer to understanding our target audience, their drivers, inclination \u0026amp; behaviour, so we can come at actionable insights on how modify and optimize our product pages to serve value and solve pain-points.\nHypotesis Construction Before we start measuring interactions or writing customer interviews we\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating an hypothesis on how a specific point of interaction, a page, or a flow may be better constructed to the target audiences and for what reasons. Only once we have a solid idea of what we\u0026rsquo;re searching for will we be able to effectively define our analytics and write our customer interviews. Our aim when constructing an hypothesis would be:\nRemoving Friction As we evaluate our funnels, and the number of users converting at each stage we’ll attempt to identify those specific steps which have the most friction, i.e have an unproportional amount of user churn. We\u0026rsquo;ll then evaluate the wireframes and page-behavior in order to hypothesize exactly what is causing this friction so how we may offer a design variation and test it for better results and lower friction.\nIdentifying Desire Paths As we evaluate user-interactions throughout the user-flows we’ll attempt to identify specific pathways which are getting an unproportional amount of interactions considering our currently defined user-path. By identifying these desire-paths we’ll optimize our product’s user-paths and wireframes to better accommodate the purpose of the desire-paths we\u0026rsquo;ve discovered.\nQuantitative Research Quantitative research is an empiric, measurable research of user interactions throughout our funnels, landing pages and product pages, so we can gather insights regarding what users do.\nTools such as Google Analytics (GA), will give us a macro-view of how users interact with our product pages allowing us to segment them according to demographics, previous interactions and more as well as view a cohort chart in order to find friction points for specific user-types or personas.\nTools such as Mixpanel allow us to also have a micro-view of user-interactions, mapping out unique user sessions that have taken place, and walking us through their use of our product.\nBefore we start gathering data regarding user-segmentation and interactions, we must properly define our analytics i.e the specific interactions that will be measured and the customer-cohorts or groups according to our hypothesis.\nQualitative Research Qualitative research is a subjective research involving surveys and user interviews so we can gather insights regarding what users say, their thoughts, opinions and understanding of our product, it’s value, and user experience.\nUser surveys are generally run via web forms or chatbots while user interviews may be conducted via phone, skype or face-to-face meetings.\nJust as with quantitative analysis, it\u0026rsquo;s important to direct the interview or survey questions towards validating our hypothesis with a little bias as humanly possible. Being in shock and defensive in the face of a disconnect from our target audience during interviews takes us a step back, while an open ear and mind takes us forward.\nAt times we might find negative correlation between quantitative and qualitative tests referring to the same issue, in those cases we’ll tend to trust the quantitative, this of course doesn\u0026rsquo;t at all reduce from the importance or value of a qualitative research.\nOptimization Funnel, page, and product optimization involves hypothesizing exactly why a certain page is underperforming, then running UX research, as above, in order to make changes to it.\nOptimization is generally accomplished via split test otherwise known as A/B tests, automatically segmenting users to one of the two groups presenting each with different page variations. Group A would generally be the control group viewing old, regular and vanilla version of the page, while Group B would be presented with the new version we hypothesized would work better. As the test goes on we’ll monitor which group has better KPI rates focusing on the specific variations we’re running. for optimal results, it’s best to set several KPIs for measuring the success rate of each variation\nA/B/C/D/n tests, called multivariate test, are also possible though they are significantly more complex to analyze and require an exponentially larger sample size, so as a general rule we’ll prefer running several tests in place of a multivariate test.\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) While looking through your analytics platforms may seem like an exhaustive affair involving an innumerable amount of metrics; KPIs are here to bring order to the chaos.\nKPIs are those specific metrics which are defined as a measurement for success, usually by the Product Manager or CEO.\nMost times KPIs will be attached to a specific Objective, where different roles have different objectives and different KPIs measuring those objectives. This process is called OKRs - Objectives and Key Results. This allows for each role to focus on their specific objectives and metrics instead of sifting through endless amount of meaningless data without gaining any actionable insights or validated learning milestones.\n"

	"content": " Introduction The main challenge in developing a content strategy and copywriting and for an already existing blog is in properly defining what was, what we’re pivoting to and why. Many times previous content-strategy documents such as OKRs, brand-guidelines, etc. will be nonexistent, which will compel us to recreate them from the published content, then understand why we are pivoting to something different than what was, and then create our new strategy to solve those specific points of under-performance.\nDefining our Goal \u0026amp; OKRs We’ll start by defining the goal we want to accomplish with our new content strategy and execution, as well as the desired objectives and metrics (KPIs) that will measure our success. These should be detached from any previous endeavors and will only define what we want to achieve presently.\nInspecting our Previous Metric Baselines Only once we’ve defined the OKRs for our new content strategy will we begin inspecting the metric-baselines our blog had previously achieved per those KPIs specifically. These baselines will act as the frame of reference against which we’ll be measuring our future performance and effectiveness.\nFormulating our Old Brand Identity Before we even begin structuring our new brand guidelines, we’ll make sure to meticulously formulate exactly what our previous brand-voice looked like, when a brand-guidelines document is nonexistent, which will often be the case, we’ll inspect our previous articles and derive the guidelines from those, creating a new document for the old brand guidelines.\nStructuring our New Brand Identity Only after we’ve formulated exactly how our previous brand identity was, we’ll begin ideating exactly what specific guidelines we’d want to either definitively modify, or test and optimize for establishing our new brand-voice\nFollowing Through From here on we’ll follow-through by establishing our content segments, roadmap, and backlog as well as write our content-pieces in very much the same fashion as previously mentioned.\n"

Quality backlinks coming from credible and high-ranking websites have a pivotal-role in ranking our website in SERPs. There are many methods, white-hat (legitimate), as well as black-hat (illegitimate) to procuring backlinks - obviously when dealing with black hat methods, such as buying links from 3rd party vendors theres a lot of risk and a small rewards if any, and these methods will many times cause more harm than good to your SEO status.\nAcquiring Blacklinks Backlinks are links arriving at our website from outside sources. Quality backlinks coming from credible and high-ranking websites have a pivotal role in ranking our website in SERPs. Similarly, backlinks arriving from low-ranking or untrustworthy websites lower our ranking upon indexing.\nCheck out this awesome HubSpot article listing white-hat methods for link-building\nCredibility \u0026amp; Reputation Not all backlinks are created the same, in fact there are some backlinks that can even hurt your position on SERPs, depending on where they\u0026rsquo;re coming from. This has to do with the credibility and reputation of the website who\u0026rsquo;s doing the backlinking, if it\u0026rsquo;s a low-reputation site such as a scam, porn-site, black-hat forum, the backlink provided will most likely reduce our SEO position. if it\u0026rsquo;s from a very well established website with good reputation, let\u0026rsquo;s take TechCrunch for the sake of example, then it can even elevate our SEO ranking ten-fold.\nA great tool for researching website ranking\u0026rsquo;s is Moz Lin Explorer\nNegative SEO \u0026amp; Disavow Links When we see a low ranking website providing a backling to our website, it\u0026rsquo;s important for us to disavow that link in order to keep our SEO standing using Google Search Console\nInterlinks, Website \u0026amp; Content Organization Interlinks are links from one page on our domain to another page on the same domain. While Interlinks won’t elevate our SEO ranking in any way, they will make our website more index-digestible and engage our user-base more effectively by advising with the content-segments and user-engagement with one article opening up to several more to keep session-engagement on our domain, as well as allow backlinkers to link to article-series instead of just one article.\nSilos is a highly effective method of website organization moving from longtail keywords to larger themes with one website organizational architecture. Read More\nOther Tips for improving SEO Ranking Publish Long Content (at least 1,000+ words) Data from a few industry studies indicate the correlation between long content (1000+ words) and higher rankings. This is not difficult to understand, as mentioned in “Longtail Keywords” section, as the number of long-tail searches performed are increasing every day. Additionally, web users are becoming smarter every day. They want specific answers to specific questions. The long-form content pieces perform better and add immense value to your audience by going beyond just scratching the surface. Your content strategy needs to match their increasing savvy.\nEmail Outreach The first step of any email outreach campaign is to find people that already write about your content’s topic. You could go to the blog directory site ALLTop.com and search, for example, “best \u0026lsquo;your topic\u0026rsquo; blogs”. Then, you could choose the sites from the results and make further efforts to have them check out your content.\nTo get in touch the people you just found, the two-step email outreach process.  Step 1 : To avoid annoying someone that is not interested in your content, the first email is a “feeler” email, which just simply gauges the person’s interest in your content.\n Step 2 : If you receive the response, then you could start your pitch.\n  The two-step email outreach process converts much better while most people send their link pitch in their first email and get poor reply rate.\n"

	"content": " In contrast to Paid Advertising, Organic marketing involves using content on our social media accounts without a budget.\nBranding Let’s start by defining exactly what branding means: branding efforts affirm and maintain the image that our business carries with it\u0026ndash; its voice, message, and market niche, in an objective for growth in user reach and engagement. We do so by delivering content in which our audience might find value as well as attract new users to quickly understand what we do and how to compartmentalize our brand in their own minds and market understanding. Branding is measured first by impressions i.e views, and second by engagements such as likes, shares, clicks, retweets, mentions, etc.\nIn order to expand the reach of our brand beyond its own scope and out into that of its entire market-niche we might want to share and post links to content curated from similar brands as well as @mention some of those brands to further assimilate our own brand as part of its market and industry. Beware not to post too much content from any one singular brand, while we do want to be affiliated with them we don’t want to market their brand or product instead of our own. Content publishers, social communities and blogging platforms such as Forbes, The Guardian, Medium, Reddit, Hacker News \u0026amp; Google Trends are great resources for finding relevant brand content, though sometimes a google search might work even better.\nOrganic (our own) brand content should focus on case-studies \u0026amp; storytelling, describing how real users benefit from our product and the story of the people behind the product, People being the operative word. We’ll also try to include our posts as part of larger conversations, within context, take notice not to spam, not use the most popular keywords, or keywords which were popular but are no longer trending, nor keywords no one uses.\nYou don’t want to get lost in a pond that’s too big, nor be contained in an unengaging conversation.\nMarketing Marketing efforts are limited to those specific posts aimed at presenting users with our products and services, leading them to our website or landing pages via a call-to-action (CTA) and converting them to register, purchase and use those services. Unlike branding, marketing success is measured by click-through-rate (CTR) and conversion rate, so no amount of likes or shares will save you when your audience simply won’t convert leaving you only to scream ‘submit the !@#$% form already!’\nThe above ad for Rolls-Royce, considered to be on of the most successful ad campaigns in history, has a lot to teach\u0026ndash; from the product research that’s been done to come up with that specific headline, to the boldly marked price tag aimed at qualifying leads, and the brief bullet points characterizing the article aiming at catching the reader\u0026rsquo;s attention span continuously.

During our research we\u0026rsquo;ll attempt to viably understand exactly what those pain points are, what is their urgency and if our hypothesized pain points are indeed corroborated with customer engagement.\nProduct Value Proposition Our value proposition, as the name implies, proposes a solution for the customer\u0026rsquo;s pain via the use of our product.\nThe value proposition is closely aligned with the Unique Selling Point (USP) used by the sales \u0026amp; marketing teams and sets the points of value customers will look for in our product. Thus we\u0026rsquo;ll use the knowledge and data gathered by marketing teams regarding they\u0026rsquo;re USP as well as our data on feature-adoption to gather insights regarding our product\u0026rsquo;s true value as perceived by our customers.\nKeep in mind that a broad value proposition that solves many problems with low urgency is in many cases not as effective as a narrow value proposition that solves a very painful problem for the same audience.\nUser Personas User personas describe archetypes of audiences who will be using our product, their goals, expectations, pain-points, aptitude and behavior. During our research we\u0026rsquo;ll attempt to gather data in order to validate or optimize our user personas in order to have the best and most accurate description of our target audience and customer-base.\nWireframes Mockups \u0026amp; wireframes place the component layout of a webpage or app screen\u0026ndash; buttons, forms, fields, menus, dropdowns, images, etc. specifying the location and behavior of each.\nThere are several tiers for mockup quality, from conceptual low-fidelity sketches, to high-quality visual designs, each have their own use for the UX designer and product manager.\nFor you, these represent, most of all, the pool of measurable interactions available to the user at any given screen or page. and we\u0026rsquo;ll try to optimize these wireframes to best engage and service our customers.\nUser Flows User flows are essentially flow-charts describing the various paths our users may take throughout our app-screens or web-pages. Some may already make use of the screen wireframes to describe this flow while others simply include symbols, text \u0026amp; color-coded paths to symbolize the user\u0026rsquo;s transition between the different pages and the main points of interactions available at each.\nDuring our research we\u0026rsquo;ll attempt to study, understand and optimize these paths in order and our customers validated flow as to deliver value in the most convenient and intuitive of ways.\nLanding Pages Landing Pages (LPs) are specific-campaign-oriented pages upon which users land after clicking a post or ad delivered by our marketing team. Different landing pages differ from each other as well as the homepage, attempting to engage a specific type of user arriving from a specific type of campaign.\nLPs are a great tool for optimizing our value proposition, user personas, and more.\nFunnels Much like user-flows, funnels are pathways a user takes to arrive at a specific destination.\nUnlike user-flows, these funnels are very specific at arriving at a desired business outcome in place of mapping-out all possible user destinations.\nFunnels are named as such due to the fact that throughout, fewer users convert.\nHere are a couple of examples for funnels:\n"

	"content": " Understanding our email list Personalized email messages today comprise 58% of all marketing revenue, improve CTR by an average of 14% and conversions by an average of 10% in relating to generic marketing messages.\nBy segmenting our existing email list into smaller groups with different types of audiences we may effectively personalize the types of content \u0026amp; messages we’ll want to deliver to those audiences to better intrigue \u0026amp; engage them.\n\nOur audience segments can vary widely depending on our market, our product, and our audiences. Optimally we would use our buyer personas or user personas to offer ideas for how to segment our audience.\nJust in case these are non-existent here are a few examples to tickle your fancy:\nSome business facing segments might include:\n- Job function - Industry - Company size - Seniority - Country - Timezone - Language  A few consumer-facing examples would be:\n- Geolocation - Place of Residence - Timezone - Language - Gender  A few segment examples concerning user-brand engagement could be:\n- Cart Abandonment more than 12 ago. - More than 1 month since last visit on the website. - Less than a week since last social engagement (like, comment, etc.) - Less than 3 weeks since last purchase - Purchased from category X - Registered to our website without purchasing over 3 days ago - Customer lifecycle stage - Opened welcome email - Clicked through welcome email  Just as there are many types of segments, there are also many types of methods to collect the user-data required for the segmentation, some examples of these methods may be:\n Manually or automatically scraping social profiles by email address or full name Asking multiple choice questions as part of the initial registration form. These would preferably be optional fields. Using Zapier, or similar, to link data from our website, social presence, analytics platform or other, and attribute it to users in our email marketing platform. Include a segmenting question in our welcome email, with several clickable answers, each directing the user to a similar thank you page, and segmenting them into different groups appropriately.  Once we’ve segmented our audience into sufficiently small and relevant groups we’ll be able to better personalize and automate the messages we send them, with the aim of increasing our CTR, in-site engagement, conversion rates and open-rates, from our current baselines, and per audience segment.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "It\u0026rsquo;s time to understand all the terms and concepts we\u0026rsquo;ve used so far an more. So, let’s get started!\nConsumer: A consumer is a private individual, not an organization or a business.\nSMB: Small and Medium Business (SMBs) are local business such as restaurants, hotels, with a limited amount of employees. While startups are similar to SMBs in amount of employees they are very different than them in terms of revenue and business models and are therefore categorized separately from SMBs.\nStartup: A Startup is a human institution, a company, or a team designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty such as an unknown market, uneducated market, first product of it\u0026rsquo;s kind and more..\nMLE: Medium and Large Enterprises refers to companies with 100+ employees (medium) or with 500+ employee (large). Examples of enterprises would be Adobe, Microsoft, Salesforce, Intel and more.\nConsumer Facing: Consumer facing products and services target private individuals. Facebook, SnapChat, Tinder, Spotify are all consumer facing products\nBusiness Facing: Business facing products and services target SMBs, Startups or MLEs. SalesForce, LinkedIn Recruiter, Slack, Facebook Workplace are all business facing products\nEnterprise Facing: The reason Enterprise is separated from business facing, is due to the fact that the sales process is a lot longer filled with much more friction for enterprise companies when in startups or SMBs in barely exists. Creating Enterprise facing products entails the understanding the getting the first customer will take a while, Vs. a consumer facing product which can possibly go viral in days.\nCEO: The Chief Executive Officer is the leader of the entire company, he carries his attention wherever it\u0026rsquo;s needed most as well as oversee the entire company.\nCMO: The Chief Marketing Officer manages the entire marketing efforts and employees that manage them.\nCTO: The Chief Technology Officer managers the entire developer team, project managers, and IT department.\nCOO: The Chief Operations Manager oversees the entire company and is responsible for the entire operations of the company, including office management, supplier management, resource management(cars, flights, etc), making sure each all departments have the personnel they need and more.\nCFO: The Chief Financial Officer oversees the company spending, burn, revenue, taxes, and more.\nBurn rate: The burn rate is a measure of how long a company can keep operating until it has to seek more financing. Burn rate is normally used to describe the rate at which a new company is spending its venture capital to finance overhead before generating positive cash flow from operations; it is a measure of negative cash flow. Burn rate is usually quoted in terms of cash spent per month.\nOnboarding: Refers to a grace period of learning, and depends highly on context. When speaking of employee it refers to the time it takes for the employee to learn the ropes and start being productive. When speaking of user onboarding refers to a tutorial or teaching session at the beginning of using the product.\nLead / Prospect: a lead is an individual or organization with an interest in what you are selling. The interest is expressed by sharing contact information, like an email, a phone number, or even a social media handle.\nCold Lead - Is a lead which either hasn\u0026rsquo;t heard of our brand and product or one which just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have us on his mind. Just because a lead is cold, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that they can\u0026rsquo;t be nurtured into becoming a paying customer.\nHot Lead - It is a lead who recently showed interest in our product in one way or another, like leaving his details on our website, for instance.\nCustomer: A customer is a person or company who had purchased our product.\nAudience Cohort: Audiences can be segmented or divided to different groups called Cohorts according to models such as the customer lifecycle or by month of registration. Splitting up all our leads into cohorts an looking at their behavior \u0026amp; revenue grants a lot of insight. Here are two examples of how of segmented cohorts of the target audience:\nBy behavior and converison rate: By month of registration Friction: Refers to an evidence that something is causing delay or failure, depends highly on context, when speaking of user friction indicates that users don\u0026rsquo;t convert at some point. when speaking of project it indicates that someone or some group of people are causing delay and noise. A lot of friction at one point causes a bottleneck.\nMRD: The Market Requirements Document gives out the layout for the competitors of our product, as well as our target audience, their demographics, personas, concerns and more.\nUSP: The Unique Selling Points sometimes referred to as Unique Selling Proposition is a clear statement that describes the unique benefit of our product, how it solves a customer’s needs and what distinguishes use from the competition.\nPersona: A persona is a model of a person or organization which we work with in one way or another, its generally based on user research and incorporates the needs, goals, demographics, concerns and observed behavior patterns of our target audience.\nA User Personas describe how different types of users may want to use our product and how they may learn of it and how to use it. They aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the ones who bought the product.\nA Buyer Persona describe hot different types of leads may want to view our product before buying and a how the learn of the product and what considerations drive them to buy\nBuyer and user personas often have different goals and expectations. The main differences are: Buyers aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily users - Take for instance child\u0026rsquo;s toy in which the parent buys it but the child uses it. User personas focus much more and on the details and ease of use, Buyer personas are more interested in higher level goals such as feature set.\nCustomer Acquisition: The act of attracting qualified leads and converting them into paying customers, The cost associated with the customer acquisition process is an important measure for a business to evaluate in combination with how much value having each customer typically brings to the business.\nCustomer Engagement: The act of engaging the target audience to stay and use our website or product continuously, with long session durations, and many sessions per day/week/month. This can be done within the product or it\u0026rsquo;s content, on social media or on our organic website and for different audience cohorts such as visitors, prospects, or active customers.\nCustomer Retention: The act of retaining the customer throughout billable periods of the year, depending on the pricing it could mean keeping the month for month, or by usage. This is extremely important, if you acquire a lot of customers but have a low retention rate, things will go south fast.\nChurn Rate: The churn rate is the weekly/monthly/yearly percentage of customers who cancel and discontinue their subscriptions. For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate, as measured by the number of new customers, must exceed its churn rate. This rate is generally expressed as a percentage.\nCAC: Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is a metric than includes all the marketing costs to Aquire one customer on average (including ads, content, landing pages and more. does not include paychecks and other operational expenses)\nARR: The Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is an average of all revenue acquired in a year and is based on the customer lifetime and amount of purchases in a year.\nMRR: The Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is an average of all revenue acquired for a month for a subscription based product, yearly payments are split into 1\u0026frasl;12 for each month instead of counting for the month the transaction was done.\nLTV: In marketing, the Lifetime Value (LTV) is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. and is calculated buy averaging\n$ \\frac{MRR}{Number of Customers \\times Churn} $\nROI: Return-on-Investment (ROI) is a metric that puts into account the the budget put into a task and the return and benefits of that task as a monetary value. It depends highly on the context and scope of the conversation - whether we\u0026rsquo;re speaking of a campaign, one of several brands, or our entire operation. When speaking of our whole operation for instance.\n$ ROI = \\frac{CAC}{LTV} $\nKeeping tabs on the ROI of your campaigns helps you make smarter decisions about how you should be allocating resources.\nMAU \u0026amp; DAU - The Monthly and Daily Active Users is the number of users who use your product on a regular basis. These have nothing to do with revenue but their a great indicator of customer retention and churn rate.\nDemographics: User demographics are broad strokes of information about them such as nationality, residence, location, gender, race, etc.\nUse Case: A use case an example or demonstration that shows the interaction between the end user and a product or service. Although use cases are most commonly used in technology settings, these demonstrations can help effectively convey benefits to customers in marketing and sales content.\nScope: The scope of a project is the definition of what it includes what is excluded from the project.\nOOS: Out of Scope refers to details which are out of scope for the project.\nTBD: To be Determined (TBD), signifies something is undecided as of yet.\nPOC: a Proof-of-Concept (POC), in marketing, refers to a valid measurement that shows there is interest in the solution we are offering. this can be attained in various manners, such as cold calling, setting up a marketing funnel, setting up a physical booth, and more depending on the product and the target audience,\nCold Calling - Cold calling is generally referring to an outgoing phone call with a cold lead who is either unengaged with our brand or, in many cases, is hearing of it for the very first time.\nCase Study: A case study is a piece of content such as an article or white-paper that presents a real world success story of someone using and benefiting from our product.\nStakeholder: Is a person, people or organization who has an interest and stake in what we\u0026rsquo;re doing such as our product or our marketing campaigns. Stakeholders are kept informed as far as the process of work continues and can affect and are affected by the strategy and execution.\nMilestone: A milestone is a predefined part of project execution, for instance if you break the creation of a new campaign into 4 parts\n Creation\n Distribution\n Result Analysis\n Validation (Success/Failure)\n  Then each of these points would be a different milestone for creating new campaigns.\nInbound Marketing: A permission-based marketing approach that focuses on attracting leads through useful content, engagement and optimization. Coined by HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan, inbound marketing is all about developing awesome content to attract and convert qualified leads.\nOutbound Marketing: Outbound marketing is a traditional method of marketing seeking to obstruct potential customer\u0026rsquo;s time by diverting their attention with ads, cold calls, and more.\nMarketing Funnel: A set of components such as posts, landing pages, articles, ads and more that are used in a set order aiming for customer acquisition. For Instance: Copy: Copywriting is the act of writing text for the marketing purposes. The product, called copy, is written content that aims to increase brand awareness and ultimately persuade a person or group to take a particular action.\nDesign: Design in marketing is more than the logos, images, page layouts, and unique fonts that comprise your brand\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic; it is the central entity that connects your company to your brand, and ultimately to your customer.\nLanding Page: A campaign-specific page distinct from your main website that has one goal and one call to action. A landing page could be a lead generation page or a click-through page for eCommerce. You should always send campaign traffic to a dedicated landing page.\nCTA: The Call to Action is the one thing you want people to click on your page. Your call to action is the big shiny button you’re trying to steer attention toward, the “ask” every campaign is built around, your landing page’s raison d’etre.\nOptimization: The process of making something as effective and cost-efficient as possible. In conversion marketing, optimization is all about using A/B testing to achieve the highest possible return on your marketing activities with the least amount of money.\nA/B Testing: A marketing experiment where two variations of a landing page, ad, email or other piece of online content are pitted against each other to determine which produces the highest conversion rate. A/B testing is the key to optimizing your marketing campaign.\nMarket Vertical: A Market Vertical is a specific niche within an industry. For instance, while Microsoft Dynamic CRM, SalesForce and HubSpot are CRM\u0026rsquo;s that aim to fit anyone, anywhere and are there for Horizontal products, Shedul which targets Spa\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; hair salons, Weeloy which targets restaurants, or CoWorkify are all vertical products, targeting a specific market vertical instead of the whole market.\nKPI / OKR: A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a metric that indicates of success or failure of a product, page, campaign, ad, etc. This metric has been specifically defined by the team as a KPI, instead of just another metric. An Objective and Key Result (OKR) is an extension of that which was first invented by google back in 1975, which adds and Objective to which the different KPIs are related to. For instance an objective would be\n Aquire new customers through social media  And the KPIs i.e Key Results, coupled with it would be\n Average Post CTR on Facebook\n Average Post CTR on Twitter\n Average Post CTR on Instagram\n Average conversion rate from Facebook visitors\n Average conversion rate from Twitter visitors\n Average conversion rate from Instagram visitors\n etc.\n  Bounce Rate: The percentage of people who arrive on your website or landing page and leave without viewing any additional pages. On a campaign-specific landing page, your bounce rate is inversely proportional to your conversion rate.\nOpen Rate: The percentage of people who open your marketing email. Open rate is calculated by dividing the number of emails opened by the total number of emails sent, excluding bounced messages. Many email service providers let you A/B test variables such as subject line and delivery time to help improve your open rate.\nCTR: The Click Through Rate (CTR) indicates at how many people see your ad or email versus how many people click on it. You want your click-through rate to be high but optimizing your CTR is only a means to achieving your campaign goal.\nConversion Rate: The percentage of people who complete your campaign goal such as purchase, registration, inquiry or other. If your conversion rate is low, it’s time to optimize your landing page or website.\nSEO : Search engine optimization refers to the work to elevate your website on search results.\nBacklink: A Link to our website from an outside website\nASO: App Store Optimization, similar to SEO.\nSMM: Social Media Marketing, refers to organic (unpaid) marketing on social media. SMO or Social Media Optimization is often used in conjunction with SMM.\nPPC : Literally translates to Pay-per-click, but refers to all Media Buying efforts including ad placements on social media, search engines, mobile apps, etc.\nSEM : Literally translates to Search Engine Marketing, refers to ad placement purchases on search engines.\nCPM: Cost per Impression (CPM) is an ad payment model where you pay for every 1000 impressions i.e views of your ad. This is in contrast to the various types of pay-for-performance advertising, whereby payment is only triggered by a mutually agreed upon activity (i.e. click-through, lead, sale).\nCPC: Cost per Click (CPC) is an ad payment model where you pay for each click on your ad instead of just the ad being viewed. If the ad is presented to a user and isn\u0026rsquo;t clicked, you don\u0026rsquo;t pay.\nCPL: Cost per Lead (CPL) is an ad payment model where you pay for each qualified lead, meaning not only was the ad presented to the user, and not only did he click it, he also filled out a form or clicked a CTA which qualifies him as a lead.\nCPA: Cost per Action (CPA) refers to the total cost of converting someone wherein action generally refers to a financial transaction or a purchase engaged by the user. Cost Per Acquisition is the ultimate metric for any marketing department because you don’t want to spend more money to convert a customer than they’re worth.\nCPI: Cost per Install (CPI) is an ad payment model where you pay for each app install.\nReferral Rate: Your referral rate is the volume of referred purchases as a % of your total purchases. So a 1% referral rate means that 1 in 100 purchases at your store happen through your referral program. An Advocate shares a referral link (typically via social media, email or IM).\nGrowth: Our growth indicates how our KPI is measuring up in relation to past results per the same KPI.\nSpecific growth and Average (mean) growth may be calculated via these two simple formulas\n$specificGrowth = \\frac{present - past}{past}$ Calculates growth between two timestamps\n$avgGrowth = (\\frac{recentTime}{firstTime})^\\frac{1}{n} -1 $ Calculates average growth between n timestamps\nRate: The rate of any KPI such as Churn Rate, Growth Rate, Conversion Rate etc. how our KPIs performance is measuring up in relation to the overall audience it was exposed to.\nIf for instance we got an average of 20 post likes per day, a month ago, where our entire page followers were 200, and today we have an average of 40 post likes per day with a following of 1200 users, it’s safe to say our user engagement is on the decline.\nRate is simply calculated as such: $\\frac{metric}{audience}$\nAvearge: While working in digital marketing it\u0026rsquo;s important to differentiate and understand the different kind\u0026rsquo;s of averages: Mean, Median, Mode, and Range\nMean: The mean average is what your used to\u0026ndash; taking the overall sum and dividing by the number of numbers included.\n$$ MeanAvg = \\frac{Sum}{#ofNumbers} $$\n$ MeanAvg(4,4,4,10,15,15,112) = \\frac{164}{7} = 23.43 $\nMedian: The median average is the middle value in the list of numbers, so if we have 7 numbers such as in (4,4,4,10,15,15,112), the median will be the 4th number (10).\nMode: The mode average is the number appearing the most times. in (4,4,4,10,15,15,112) the number 15 appears twice, and the number 4 appears three times. Therefore the mode of (4,4,4,10,15,15,112) is 4.\nActionable Insight: An insight derived from company data, campaign performance, product performance or other which directs to actions which we should start doing from now on.\n"

	"content": "   Recognizing Disruptive Technology How Kodak invented the camera that would destroy it One of the most famous case studies teaching lack of foresight when it comes to disruptive technologies involves the infamous demise of the camera and film company Kodak.\nDespite the fact that the first digital camera was invented in Kodak\u0026rsquo;s own R\u0026amp;D department by Steve Sasson in 1975, and when the first consumer product hit the market in 1981, Kodak\u0026rsquo;s own Head of Market Intelligence handed in a fairly accurate report predicting the adoption-rate of digital cameras, Kodak\u0026rsquo;s management failed to see digital cameras as disruptive technology for two decades ending up with the company filing for bankruptcy in 2012.\nHow Nokia lacked initiative to participate in the Smartphone battles Nokia, a Finnish company which started out in the pulp mill industry back in 1865, in 1960 Nokia first ventured into the telecommunication markets going from military, government and enterprise markets slowly towards consumer markets with car-phones and personal computers, until 1987 when they rolled out the first product that can truly be described as a mobile phone, the Mobira Cityman 900.\nWhile we won\u0026rsquo;t go into the inner workings of Nokia\u0026rsquo;s corporate culture \u0026amp; structure, we will establish that it is that same culture which was the main reason for their failure in adopting the innovation of smartphones. The smartphone innovation was foreseen by Nokia\u0026rsquo;s Management as early as 2005, and it was also viewed as an important shift in the market. The problem arose when the top and middle management had to do something at risk of losing their status due to shifting organizational structures.\nSo it wasn\u0026rsquo;t any lack of foresight as in Kodak\u0026rsquo;s case. It was lack of initiative and fear of internal struggles that brought Nokia to let innovation pass it by.\nNokia\u0026rsquo;s fall from grace teaches us that knowledge isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, you gotta have the guts to do something about it.\nLearn More Learn even more..\nConclusion Lack of foresight to recognize disruptive technologies and lack of initiative to move with innovation and not against it can lead even the largest entities to financial decay. While similar cases such as Blockbuster vs. Netflix, exist and will continue to exist. The case of the Blockchain vs. Bank or Crypto vs. FIAT is not the same. Faithfully a wide range of financial institutions have recognized the disruptive technology that is the blockchain and began to develop and adopt it, even partially. So there are no worries about the blockchain bankrupting the entire banking system.\nHistory of the Blockchain The foundations of the blockchain have been conceptualized as early as 1990 and refined by Haber and associates up until 1992.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t until 2008 when the subject suddenly re-surfaced by an anonymous alias only known as Satoshi Nakamoto who soon after, released the first version of Bitcoin on SourceForge in 2009\nThe rest, as they say, is history. One of rapid growth in both capital, sustainability, use cases and number of players.\nYou can learn more of the fork-history of cryptocurrencies visually on Map of Coins\nBenefits of Blockchain By solving the double-spending problem in an effective and autonomous manner and not requiring intermediaries to validate the transfer of assets or currency, the blockchain has given us the potential to significantly lower the costs of transactions of all kinds - logistic, financial, legal and more. with game-changing consequences to costs of transferring goods, services, assets, and currency across the globe.\nThe blockchain also offers the possibility of contracts that are autonomously enforceable called Smart Contracts, these contracts manage the transfer of funds and the conditions of ownership without requiring intermediaries such as courts of law.\nUsing the IPFS protocol on top of a blockchain solves the short life-span of online web pages enabling the longevity if information through a method of storing \u0026amp; sharing rich media websites. In other words, this gives the potential for a decentralized and uncensorable web including file sharing.\nMarket Adoption of Blockchain Technologies. Blockchain\u0026rsquo;s popularity is on the rise, from consumer-facing money-management and trading solutions, to enterprise compliance \u0026amp; regulation solutions, ready to use blockchain infastructures and even attempting to solve the major ownership problem of DNA samples, Great, but how much money does this a niche startup industry actually bring?\nWell, so far the blockchain startups have gained a rapid growth in VC funds headed its way, expanding at a median rate of 150% per year since 2012 when it collected 25,000 dollars in VC funding, to 2018 when it collected $1.3B, so far.\nPutting startup projects aside, large enterprise corporations are far from being left out in the dust. JP Morgan is working on numerous projects along with Quorom which it launched earlier this year.\nIBM, Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, and Amazon have all launched several blockchain solutions covering a range of market verticals and use cases.\nRead more on blockchain adoption rate at Forbes.\nWhen thinking of the possibilities of this solution outside the standard use-case of a private currency, this solution to the double-spending problem solves major issues in business, such as logistics management, contract management, copyright management; as well as government such as identity management, asset management, government budget management, public transport and more. all of these have their own set of use cases, for example, identity management can be used for cross-service identity management and individual identification and even allow for online voting, with minimal concerns to identity theft.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at some of the ways the blockchain is being utilized today and might be utilized in the coming future\nCase Studies \u0026amp; Use Cases In what may well be a state-wide embarrassment Russia should soon launch it\u0026rsquo;s CryptoRuble come 2019 on its own governmental blockchain infrastructure.\nFor good and bad the Chinese is making headway with blockchain technology with ICBC patenting its own blockchain platform and the Chinese government is piloting it\u0026rsquo;s Social Credit and Govenrnance system aimed to launch by 2020 with blockchain expected to be the underlying technology. Read More in the original research paper by Dr. Rogier Creemers.\nSouth Africa\u0026rsquo;s Central Bank had a succesful experiment with blockchain technology\nThe UK has recently published a white paper hinting towards adopting a blockchain solution for border customs and tariff control. Read More on TechCrunch\nUBS, an American investment banking company, has been an early riser to the disruptive FinTech, and had begun developing blockchain solutions as early as 2015. We highly recommend reviewing their whitepaper on how to utilize blockchain technology as a trust and regulatory mean.\nThe government of Malta, which is hyper-aware of blockchains potential, has started collaborating with Omnitude to create the first governmental public transport system backed by blockchain technology. On top of being the first to enact the first laws regulating blockchain technology and cryptocurrency transactions.\nSupply chain management (SCM) software is being used by medium and large enterprises for cataloging the transfer of goods from the point-of-manufacturing to point-of-sell, this is a major market vertical worth $12.2B with rapid yearly growth (~12.7% in 2017). all major retail and wholesale providers use such solutions and may soon transfer to a more efficient blockchain based solution such as provenance, skuchain, Blockverify and most notably SAP.\nRide-Sharing has gained a lot of traction in recent years, and already it might be facing disruption with blockchain technology.\nDiDi might not have been the first, but by dominating the Chinese market has become the biggest ride-sharing app valuated at $55B. They have recently put out a press release that they\u0026rsquo;ll be integrating blockchain technology as part of their product\nOther companies such as DASCEE or ArcadeCity are also attempting\nRead More on how blockchain can benefit the ride-sharing industry.\nOnline voting is another one of the problems blockchain aims to solve with services such as Agora or Voatz who\u0026rsquo;ve already piloted their solution in West Virginia\u0026rsquo;s state election.\nMore robust solutions aim to fix the democratic process itself through digital means. Projects such as Liquid Democracy target domestic (US) as well as foreign government bodies to use their new model for a liquid democracy.\nIn the healthcare industry the blockchain is helping candidates take control of their samples\u0026rsquo; proprietary value through the blockchain, with other applications already seen on the horizon.\nCloud storage is maintained today with central servers spread across the world giving that give rise to problems such as end-user proximity to the servers, costs of establishing data centers and more. Projects such as STORJ aim to solve these problems using the blockchain.\nRead More on Forbes.\nSolving the problems of copyright records and management has been a huge hurdle for artists and government alike. Using Smart Contracts as well as retaining ownership of a media file to the original artist using blockchain aims to abolish this problem.\nRead More in Alexander Savelyev\u0026rsquo;s study.\n"

We want you to know how to get results and achieve success as a digital marketer and that’s possible only through autonomous and continuous learning.\nOnce upon a time there was a saying in business, ABC, Always Be Closing, made famous by the movie GlenGary Glenn Ross, But when dealing with innovation closing just isn’t enough of a measurement for success, not even revenue growth is enough, that is because most of the time we’re selling or creating products that are completely new, both to us as suppliers and to the audiences we market to.\nIn this industry, that of digital products, it’s learn or die, and you need to Always be Learning, Your competitors, your target audience, their different segments, the overall market size, your own market-share, you’re marketing language, the performance of your website and the viable alternatives to each of its’ pages, new tools and their benefits, new mediums for advertising, It never ends, literally never ends. And this is the part of the job that’s always constant, you always, Always need to research and learn new things and how to do so effectively, basing your research on a core world of business concepts.\nEach of us learn in our own way, some read lots of blogs, some find case studies, some listen to podcasts. Personally, I like books, they have the capacity to tell a entire story, instead of just bits and pieces, for me they put information from blogs or podcasts into context. There are two books i’d like to suggest to you at this time.\nHow Stella saved the Farm which is a simple, even juvenile allegory for innovation\nAnd The Lean Startup, which is a thorough, real world guide to the same method of innovation.\nA second method of learning love work and hands-on experience, getting feedback from actual leads and clients for good or bad teaches important lessons. from ads, emails, social posts, articles, feature adoption and user interactions, researching how each milestone of our creation is captured by the target audience teaches us how to move forward.\nSo, i would like to suggest to you that whatever you hear. Anywhere, from me, from anyone, take it with a grain of salt, research those terms online, until you form your own solid understanding of them. Then take that understanding with a grain of salt, think of it as a preliminary understanding, ‘cause it’s sure to shift and change the more you learn, in the coming future.\nLet’s take a a look at several monstrous companies who went bankrupt because they refused to learn.\nHow Kodak invented the camera that would destroy it One of the most famous case studies teaching lack of foresight when it comes to disruptive technologies involves the infamous demise of the camera and film company Kodak.\nDespite the fact that the first digital camera was invented in Kodak\u0026rsquo;s own R\u0026amp;D department by Steve Sasson in 1975, and when the first consumer product hit the market in 1981, Kodak\u0026rsquo;s own Head of Market Intelligence handed in a fairly accurate report predicting the adoption-rate of digital cameras, Kodak\u0026rsquo;s management failed to see digital cameras as disruptive technology for two decades ending up with the company filing for bankruptcy in 2012.\nHow Nokia lacked initiative to participate in the Smartphone battles Nokia, a Finnish company which started out in the pulp mill industry back in 1865, in 1960 Nokia first ventured into the telecommunication markets going from military, government and enterprise markets slowly towards consumer markets with car-phones and personal computers, until 1987 when they rolled out the first product that can truly be described as a mobile phone, the Mobira Cityman 900.\nWhile we won\u0026rsquo;t go into the inner workings of Nokia\u0026rsquo;s corporate culture \u0026amp; structure, we will establish that it is that same culture which was the main reason for their failure in adopting the innovation of smartphones. The smartphone innovation was foreseen by Nokia\u0026rsquo;s Management as early as 2005, and it was also viewed as an important shift in the market. The problem arose when the top and middle management had to do something at risk of losing their status due to shifting organizational structures.\nSo it wasn\u0026rsquo;t any lack of foresight as in Kodak\u0026rsquo;s case. It was lack of initiative and fear of internal struggles that brought Nokia to let innovation pass it by.\nNokia\u0026rsquo;s fall from grace teaches us that knowledge isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, you gotta have the guts to do something about it.\nLearn More Learn even more..\nThis doesn’t mean you need to delay work because you’re still learning, it means that the work itself is the process from which you gain knowledge, and doing things you don’t know perfectly will get you there.\nWork to learn, Learn by Doing.\nGood Luck from QLC.\n"

	"content": " While it may seem trivial that the integrity of our dataset is flawless, and that each datapoint is reliable in it\u0026rsquo;s naming convention along with its flow across different platforms. most times this is hardly the case.\nThus, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary for us, as analytics specialists, both to define the naming conventions of our datasets as well as run QA tests on the analytics setup created by the development team so we don\u0026rsquo;t wake up 3 months into the data collection process and realize we severely misinterpreted our data the entire time.\nData Flow While many times data flow will be fairly simple, going straight from our app or website into our analytics platform, in some instances things won\u0026rsquo;t be so simple such as measuring how many users encountering our landing page installed our mobile app. in this instance our user\u0026rsquo;s ID parameters need to transfer from our landing page to the AppStore, then into our app and to our analytics platform from there, thus a single user creates several data points that cross 4 different platforms in order for us to read it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at several different methods for data transfer, and how to utilize them.\nWebsites \u0026amp; Web-apps URL Parameters These are parameters attached to a URL in Address link via the ? symbol. These have varied uses, from keeping search queries, user data, arrival sources to our URL, and more.\nhttps://www.google.co.il/search?q=search+for+common+ground\u0026amp;oq=search+for+common+ground\u0026amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4243j0j7\u0026amp;sourceid=chrome\u0026amp;ie=UTF-8  In this example we see that:\n?q=.. is the user\u0026rsquo;s search query,\n\u0026amp;sourceid=.. is where the query was entered. since it\u0026rsquo;s a added to another parameter it uses the \u0026lsquo;\u0026amp;\u0026rsquo; symbol instead of ?.\n\u0026amp;ie=.. is the encoding used on the users browser.\nThe rest are google proprietary information, and though it\u0026rsquo;s completely unnecessary, here\u0026rsquo;s where you can read more about them.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s where you can learn more about URL parameters.\nUTM Codes UTM codes are standard URL parameters used for analytics purposes. These codes provide us with a tool to measure the performance of our inbound links and track the amount of traffic coming from each of our publishing platforms, search results and ad-placements.\nUsing UTM codes, which are read as a standard by all analytics platforms e.g KissMetrics, Mixpanel, Heap and of course Google Analytics, you can track broad sets of data such as how much traffic your receiving from each platform (google search, google adwords, facebook, twitter, etc.), You can also track highly specific data such as how much traffic you\u0026rsquo;re getting from the Call-to-Action on your Facebook page against each post on the same page.\n   UTM Parameter Purpose Example Required?     source Indicates which domain sent the traffic our way utm_source=Facebook V   medium Indicates which type of link was used, cost-per-click, post, email, etc. utm_medium=PageCTA V   campaign Indicates the name of our campaign and has varied uses. utm_campagin=spring_sale V   term Identifies search terms used by the user utm_term=running+shoes+sale X   content identifies the specific component clicked by the user that referred them to our website utm_content=logoclick utm_content=textclick utm_content=titleclick X   id the campaign id is used to attribute all other parameters like campaign or source in accordance with the id utm_id=google_CPC_july X    When defining and implementing you UTM parameters in posts, content, page components etc. keep the following in mind: 1. Do not use them for internal links on your own website. Following user interactions using UTM codes is a futile effort and there are far more advanced techniques for this attempt. The use of UTM codes, as we said, is following outside traffic sources leading to our website.\n Make sure to properly mark and segment paid traffic using the utm_medium parameter e.g CPC or CPM, from organic traffic such as posts or articles. Not doing so will weaken your position to establish return-on-investment from paid sources and will highly damage your competence to derive actionable insights from your analytics. Not documenting your UTM code placement could be a fatal error leading to severe ambiguity later on. Do make sure to create a shareable sheet and tracking your UTM Codes. Use this template the utm_campaign parameter is highly versatile and can be used a great number of ways such as tracking campaigns for:  Seasonal promotions A specific product line such as shoes, jackets, t-shirts A specific brand such as nike, adidas, etc. A targeted buyer persona such as programmer-Tim, projectManager-Kevin . A specific outcome from the call-to-action such as hot-lead,cold-lead,trial, beta-request, add-to-cart   These sorts of naming conventions allow you to measure you\u0026rsquo;re campaign results and compare them over time via these segments, so useful.\nIn order to avoid the complexity of writing the the full URL including all UTM codes you may want to use Google URL Builder. And so we don\u0026rsquo;t present the user with long and suscpicious links, we\u0026rsquo;ll shorten our URLs using bit.ly or similiar.\nUTM.io is also a great tool for working with UTMs. It integrates URL building, shortening \u0026amp; tracking, so convenient.\nJavaScript Integrations Analytics platforms such as Heap, Mixpanel, CrazyEgg, HotJar in general are integrated into websites \u0026amp; web-apps via inserting a JavaScript tracking snippet into our page\u0026rsquo;s code. Though it\u0026rsquo;s literally as simple as copy-pasting, it must be attached to each and every one of our webpages.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s and example from HeapAnalytics on how to insert a snippet into your webpages for one of many analytics platforms. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change YOUR_APP_ID parameter to your account details.\nWhen using multiple platforms it may seem like you need to insert multiple snippets, one per platform, into your \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;, this arises concerns towards a slowdown page-loading-time. for this we\u0026rsquo;ll use a Tag Manager such as GTM, which allows for us to integrate a single, permanent snippet into our webpages and use a the Tag Manager to add, remove and manage integrations of various analytics platforms that will receive data via that same snippet.\nEvent tracking While it may be tempting to track all events on your website without discriminations it important to remember that the product of good analytics isn\u0026rsquo;t a wide collection of data-sets, but the quick arrival at actionable insights from those data sets. To the latter, auto-tracking events are most times counterproductive due to computer-generated naming conventions and lack of relation to other data sets used to form funnels.\nThus it is best to define the events you\u0026rsquo;ll be tracking and the questions or hypotheses these events will be tied to before any data has been collected.\nCustom Properties While each analytics platform has a standard set of properties which tell us more about the user, such as location, timestamp, operating system, browser, etc. We may require further details to arrive at meaningful conclusions. Thus after setting our events we should want to create custom events to have some more context for each type of user.\nData Coherence When initially defining our dataset, prior to the data collection, It’s important to name each of our parameters as well as their values in a manner which we’ll be able to immediately recognize when we approach the data analysis. Naming a parameter triggered on the first app onboarding screen “FinishedOnboarding”, for instance, would be a bad idea, because for the user the onboarding just started.\nSignificance of Results Sample Size vs. Effect Size Allow me to quote Phillip Porter of MecLabs for a second, as he clears everything up pretty neatly:\n “Significance is based on sample size and effect size. The larger the sample you have, the smaller effect size you can find to be significant. The larger the effect size present, the smaller sample size you need to find significance. Larger sample sizes are generally better, however any difference, no matter how small, can be found to be significant with a large enough sample size.”\n Whereas sample size refers to the overall amount of people participating in the A/B test and effect size refers to the 𝚫delta between the two groups.\n$ EffectSize = \\frac{Mean A - Mean B}{StandardDeviation} $\nAs a general rule we’ll be needing a sample size of a couple of thousand users per test, at the least. We’ll also need to record the test results through time and not as any one final measurement. Like anything though, it’s all a matter of finding the right measure and relying on good intuition, your own as well as that of your team.\nEvan Miller’s A/B test calculator is my personal favorite and an industry standard,\nHere’s another set of calculators, not as popular but useful non-the-less in helping you with deciding on proper sample sizes, effect sizes and confidence levels. There are many more out there just a google search away.\n"

Per timeframe, establishing our growth rate per day, week and month. Per article, examining how each article we published is performing. at times old articles might still be bringing-in traffic while new and less engaging articles underperform. Per distribution platform - sometimes we’ll publish the same article on several platforms, results are sure to be different and will direct us towards those platforms that will work and are working best for our brand. Per engagement type - some user-engagements are more valuable and others less. A share, comment or page-like might be more valuable than a simple like on an article-piece.

	"content": " Introduction Facebook is a social platform focused on profiles first, communities (groups) second, and only recently began its focus on conversations.\nPage Setup So we\u0026rsquo;re going to be working with Facebook Pages, in contrast to profiles, groups or events.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the different components involved in an FB Page:\n Profile picture\n Cover photo/video\n About and Info\n Settings\n Shop, Products and Services\n  In order to set up all of our image assets quickly and easily, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna be using a free tool called ArtStudio courtesy of Postcron, that should take care of the image sizes and allow us to design them with ease.\nDo take some time to familiarize yourself with it, though it really is dead-simple and very intuitive.\nAdd a Profile Picture Minimal image specs: 180x180px Display specs: 160x160px (desktop), 140x140px (mobile) Video: Unavailable for pages It would generally be our company logo 🌇  Upload a Cover Photo Minimal Image specs: 399x150px Video specs: 820x312px (minimum), 820x462px (recommended), 20-90 seconds Display specs: 820x312px (desktop), 640x360px (mobile), video loops, audio muted by default and can be turned on by user.  That\u0026rsquo;s right, while there is no profile video, there is a cover video available which is pretty rad if you\u0026rsquo;ve got the video assets 🎬.\nTake notice not to include any of the following in your cover photo or video:\n Price and purchase information\n Contact information\n References to Facebook features or actions\n Calls-to-action\n  Write the About Info Fill in according to the company\u0026rsquo;s brand message and guidelines.\n* Website URL * Address, email, phone number * About (155 characters) * Mission and Long description-- for more than just 155 characters. * Custom Facebook URL/ Username e.g @MyBrand (only available after 25-page likes) * Add a call to action button -- you only get one CTA so use it wisely. * Categories, interests, etc.  Create Custom and Social Tabs Tabs appear at the pane to the left of your page for visitors to see, click and engage.\nWhile it’s unfortunate you can’t create any tab you like on your own, there’s no shortage of apps on the Facebook app store- from social tabs to FAQ’s, forms and website integrations.\nFNMaker and FBapp.us are popular app providers offering great apps for page tabs.\nI’d suggest trying them out before you lock in on a specific app and checking that it behaves as you want on the user’s end and is also comfortable for you to manage, there are always alternatives.\nManage Page Settings The settings menu is a powerful and comprehensive page management and customization tool, While we won’t touch each and every tab here, we will walk through the main points you’ll want to look out for.\nEdit Page Here you can edit and rearrange your tabs and CTA, either via your own customization or from the ready-made templates offered by Facebook.\nGeneral Here you’ll find a lot of helpful features such as multi-language posts; profanity and keyword filters to disallow certain comments; audience restrictions aimed at hiding the page from an excluded audience and much, much more.\nMessaging Here you’ll be able to configure greetings, auto-replies and more, pretty neat 🙌\nPeople and Other Pages At times you’ll find various trolls and unpleasant visitors engaging with your brand, here you’ll be able to ban and remove these users from engaging with your brand. But beware not to overstep and always make customer satisfaction your first priority!\nPage Affiliations and Collaboration Using the** Branded Content and Featured tabs you’ll be able to tag and feature other brands you’re collaborating with or ones you want your own brand to be affiliated with, pretty cool.\nShop, Products, and Services This is a nice place to list some of the company\u0026rsquo;s products, services, and pricing just to catch the visitor\u0026rsquo;s eye.\nTake notice that these items come without a CTA so don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to convert any visitors, but it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have just FYI.\nReview Your Page Now that we’re ready to accept visitors into our page, let’s take a look at exactly how it will be presented to them using the ‘*view as a page visitor*’ function on the toolbar below our cover photo.\nOrganic Marketing Our page is now all set up and ready to get some traffic, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to start promoting it organically (in contrast to paid adverts) with posts, shares, tags, community reach, and content curation.\nCommunity Reach The first rule of thumb for handling our page is to be as responsive and helpful as possible to visitors commenting questions and messaging your page\u0026ndash; FB can and will rate your page according to your message responses, and visitors even more so, so do keep your finger on the pulse.\nTo get the \u0026lsquo;Very responsive to messages\u0026rsquo; badge your Page must have achieved both of the following over the last seven days:\nA response rate of 90% or more\nA response time of 15 minutes or less\nfeaturing, liking and @tagging similar brands on our page and posts are good methods for affiliating our brand to stronger similar ones. we’ll also attempt to take part in conversations existing within relevant groups and pages in order to genuinely offer value and help user questions, not for marketing our product! take notice that spamming marketing messages on these threads is only a good idea if you want to get banned, or worse achieve negative engagements and feedback.\nBranding Using curated and organic content (around a 60% / 40% ratio), we’ll start scheduling 5-8 weekly posts using either SMM platforms such as Hootsuite and dlvr.it or simply via Facebook’s post scheduling dashboard available at Publishing Tools scheduled posts, With every post we’ll use Facebook’s post targetingto make sure we’re engaging our target-audience specifically.\ntake notice that batch posting has been found to be not only less effective but also counterproductive, appearing to users as concentrated spam on their timeline and resulting in unfollowers, blocks, and reports.\nMarketing So after we’ve gained enough traction with our branding efforts we’ll post a 1~2 marketing message per week (targeted at those specific days and times where our users are most engaged) in an attempt to leverage our brand into converting users to register, buy and use our services.\nWhile the Facebook page view is well fitted to manage our branding efforts, marketing posts require quite a different set of features such as CTAs, carousel images, videos and presentations which are all available in Facebook’s PowerEditor.\nFor a larger view of the image, right-click and open in a new tab\nOffers are also a great way to gain some traction and escalate conversion rates for a certain timeframe.\nSocial Analytics OKRs Below are several suggested OKRs \u0026amp; KPIs aimed at measuring your continuous success on Facebook.\n Reach   * Page Visits * Post Impressions / Reach * Daily Impressions / Reach   Engagement   * Post Clicks * Post Likes / Reactions * Post Shares * Post Comments * Brand Mentions * Page Likes * Page CTA clicks * Monthly Active Followers * Page Ratings * Page Reviews   Behaviour \u0026amp; Conversion Rate   * Measured on our own domain via GA, Mixpanel etc. For suggested KPIs check SMM Fundamentals.  Social Media Optimization (SMO) There are many different tactics available for you to try out and optimize in order to best reach and engage your audience. Below are several of those for your inspiration. I’d advise against counting on them alone but continuously research what sort of tactics have worked or might work well for your brand, industry and audience, and do not forget to measure the result of the tactics you engage against your original OKRs, in contrast to counting on any and all available metrics which might result in a focus on vanity metrics with no real impact on the business.\nPolls Running Polls could be a highly engaging endeavor for your brand, allowing your audience to measurably express their views on a topic, which would most likely be surrounding the solution you\u0026rsquo;re offering or your brand-theme.\nPoll functionality on FB has been limited in recent months so that now it may be conducted in the following manners:\n Via a post asking for user comments,\n FB’s page poll feature, allowing for only two options, each may contain text, GIFs, and images.\n Using your private account in a group for FB\u0026rsquo;s group-poll-feature to run a poll with multiple answers as well as user-generated answers, then share the poll results on your Page.\n 3rd party apps such as MyLivePolls which offers live video reaction polls, and OpinionPolls which offers form-like multiple choice polls, are also a great choice for conducting polls to drive user engagement.\n  However you end up choosing to conduct your polls, make sure to include appropriate #hashtags on your poll question as well as share it on relevant FB groups to increase impressions and leverage it to drive engagement.\nHere’s the story of StarEmpathy\u0026rsquo;s poll to raise awareness towards 21st-century education.\nUser Generated Content (UGC) Ever Since Facebook’s IPO, organic page content has been seeing less and less appearances on newsfeeds, declining impressions and therefore fewer engagements. De Facto, the company has changed its platform’s landscape to include less and less unfunded page content to better tap into ad-buying budgets.\nFortunately, this change did not affect the appearance of private users content and posts on newsfeeds.\nAsking your user-base for their content, images, videos, opinions or take on a brand-related-subject either via comments or their own #hashtagged or @mentioned posts could be highly advantageous, again because it will successfully appear in 3rd connected newsfeeds (i.e their friends) with many more impressions than any of our organic page posts.\nThis article featuring brands big and small attempting to engage their audience to create UGC is a great starting point to inspire your future UGC campaigns.\nPrized Contests \u0026amp; Promotions There could be no better way to engage your audience, generate hype, leads, subscriptions, conversions, and even UGC, like prized contests. You may choose your winner in any number of ways, either editors-pick, most engagements collected, at random, or even give a prize to all participants as a promotion. Your prize must be something that users find valuable, but also something that’s connected to your brand. You can even give out coupons for your services at reduced prices.\nThis article featuring emerging brands engaging their audience through prized competitions is a great source of inspiration for your future ventures.\nHost a Live Stream Live streams are a feature currently being highly pushed by Facebook, So much so that even pages with no funding will appear straight away in their followers\u0026rsquo; newsfeed. The live feed can be pre-scheduled so that announcements will appear on your followers\u0026rsquo; newsfeed to alert them on the event and allow them to sign up for viewing.\nThis article featuring several success stories is sure to spark up you inner-live-streamer.\nEngaging content  Quotes - Everybody loves an insightful quote on a pretty image.\n Quality over quantity - Quality content in small doses was found to be much more engaging than a lot of low-level content.\n Foodie posts - Everybody loves food, and these dish-pics get a lot of engagement, though it is advisable to keep it somehow related to your brand.\n A weekly mix of photos, text posts and links to your blog can do wonders for your audience-engagement.\n  Tools \u0026amp; Templates Below are several products, services, and references to assist you in tackling the challenge of hacking your growth in reach and engagement.\n   TYPE PRODUCT     In-Page Analytics Facebook Insights   Advanced Admin Dashboard Facebook’s PowerEditor   In-page \u0026amp; Competitive Analytics SimplyMeasured   In-page Analytics FanpageKarma   Page Setup Evaluation likeAlyzer   Analytics Dashboard Cyfe   Analytics Dashboard Quintly   Facebook Live Video Polls MyLivePolls   Multiple Choice Polls OpinionPolls   Research Paper Mavrck FB UGC Report   Excel Addon Facebook Ad Manager    Conclusion While Facebook might be a little intimidating with its robust, dynamic, and ever-changing set of features tools and integrations, it’s important to remember what you want for your branding and marketing efforts in order to find those specific tools you actually need, and using those specific features that assist you, and not focusing on features that don’t.\n"

	"content": " Introduction Twitter is a much more minimalistic platform than, let’s say, Facebook, as is evident by their 280 character limit. It focuses on facilitating conversations first, profiles second, with communities being a natural product of the two, in place of being defined as a group, forum, sub, etc.\nAccount Setup Setting up your twitter account is pretty straightforward, and is composed of the following components.\n* Username (@UserName) * Title * Bio * Header photo * Profile photo * Location * Website * Theme Color * Birthday  In order to set up all of our image assets quickly and easily, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna be using a free tool called ArtStudio courtesy of Postcron, that should take care of the image sizes and allow us to design them with ease.\nTwitter images placed in your profile are static, so animated gifs or short videos aren’t a viable possibility for any images save for the ones in your tweets.\nUsername First, we’ll fill in our @UserName, which will preferably be our brand name alone, though if it’s taken we might need to add a word or two. We’ll try to make it as short, memorable, and in line with our brand voice as possible.\nTitle Once we have our username we can add our Title, which should be our brand name without any additions to it. This is not a unique value like the @UserName so duplication isn’t a problem and you may choose whatever title you’d like.\nBio Here we’ll write a short, 160 character, description which should deliver what we do and what’s our value to new users encountering our profile.\nHeader photo Image Specs: 1,500 x 500 pixels, 5MB maximum size  The header photo works with our theme color to create our brand presence on twitter viewable for those specific users that are visiting our profile.\nProfile photo Image specs: 400x400px, 2MB maximum size Display specs: 200x200px and below  Generally, it would be our company logo, unless otherwise instructed.\nLocation If you\u0026rsquo;re working on an online brand it’s best to leave this field blank, though if you’re working on a brand for a small or medium business (SMB) such as a local restaurant, hair salon or computer repair shop, then do make sure to let people know where they can find you.\nWebsite Just put the URL to your website, such as www.qlc.io\nTheme Color While it’s tempting to choose what you like from the rainbow of colors available, make sure to choose the main color of your brand palette which can be on your website or requested from your PM.\nColorZilla is a great tool for extracting colors from web pages and into color-hex-codes which can be easily inserted into twitter’s color settings.\nBirthday While some startups might want to put their founding date here, most brands would prefer to leave it blank.\nOur Twitter profile is all set up Easy-peasy!\nNow the first thing you’ll want to do right after finishing up your twitter profile is tweet a single marketing message directing to your website registration or purchase which should include a video or picture and a call-to-action (CTA) such as \u0026ldquo;Start your Free Trial Now\u0026rdquo;, “Buy Now”, “Read More” etc.\nThis will allow new users visiting your profile to see exactly what you\u0026rsquo;re all about. Don’t expect it to get any actual engagements though.\nLast but not least we’ll access our twitter dashboard at TwitterDeck which will allow us to manage our brand content much more comfortably.\nOrganic Marketing Branding Due to its limited amount of content per tweet, low levels of engagements per tweet, and saturated content conditions, successful Twitter accounts are tweeting 10-50 times per day.\nUnlike other platforms where batch posting may be harmful to a brand\u0026rsquo;s social presence, on twitter it’s considered all right and due to the character cap, a lot of users are using several tweets to deliver one message.\nUsing curated and organic content (around a 60% / 40% ratio), we’ll start scheduling 5~10 daily tweets using either SMM platforms such as dlvr.it and Hootsuite or Twitter’s own TwitterDeck. Add to that our retweets, and attempts at community engagement and we’re up to ~30 tweets per day.\nWe’ll also make sure to retweet any positive @mentioning of our account.\nCommunity Reach Twitter is a giant community facilitating many different conversations, so community engagement is where it really shines.\nIn order to locate our target audience, we’ll be using social analytics tools to find relevant keywords and follow successful brands and personal accounts who are reaching out to similar audiences, this should open us up to real conversations currently happening within our market niche.\nIn order to engage with our target audience we’ll jump in on those conversations via @mentions and #hashtags, not so we can market our product but to genuinely offer value and insights to the conversation and the users we\u0026rsquo;re interacting with.\nSome of those tweets would require us to do some research in order to truly offer said value, good thing we\u0026rsquo;re scrappy hard workers.\nMarketing Quick reminder, marketing messages are those specific tweets aimed at converting users to purchase, register and use your product.\nWe’re gonna schedule 1~2 marketing tweets per day which should include a call-to-action (CTA), and an image, link or video. Depending on the context of our conversations in the Twitter community, we’ll appropriately add @mentions and #hashtags, all the while being very careful not to come off as spammers.\nSocial Analytics Market Research Given how Twitter is composed of both users and conversations, market research is also split into researching brands and accounts, and researching #hashtags, keywords, and conversations, these two while separate are intertwined so when we’re researching conversations we might find new and engaging accounts to follow, and vice versa.\nOKRs Below are several suggested OKRs \u0026amp; KPIs aimed at measuring your continuous success on Twitter.\n Reach   * Profile Visits * Tweet Impressions * Daily Impressions * Profile Followers   Engagement   * Brand Mentions * Retweets * Tweet Replies * Tweet Favorites * Tweet Clicks * URL shares * Branded Hashtags   Behaviour \u0026amp; Conversion Rate   * Measured on our own domain via GA, Mixpanel etc. For suggested KPIs check SMM Fundamentals.  Social Media Optimization (SMO) There are many different tactics available for you to try out and optimize in order to best reach and engage your audience. Below are several of those for your inspiration. I’d advise against counting on them alone but continuously research what sort of tactics have worked or might work well for your brand, industry and audience, and do not forget to measure the result of the tactics you engage against your original OKRs, in contrast to counting on any and all available metrics which might result in a focus on vanity metrics with no real impact on the business.\nOpinion Polls Asking for user opinions could be highly engaging to our existing following as well as target audience, giving them an opportunity to offer their own insights on the subject at hand, be it product-feedback, content-decisions or even just-for-fun.\nYou can run your polls in several different manners, each with their own set of tradeoffs.\nTwitter Polls Allows for up to 4 different answers, closes polling within 24 hours, presents overall engagements, but doesn’t show which user voted which way.\nRetweet vs. Like Asking users to Retweet in agreement and Like in disagreement is a surefire way to get both polling results per user, as well as get more reach and impressions without a time limit.\n#hashtagged answers Another way to run a poll is offering the users several #hashtags to tweet as answers, this also allows the user to elaborate their answer, as well as expand your reach, remove the time limit, and enable seeing results per user.\nIn this article by buffer, besides an in-depth description of Twitter’s poll feature, there are several case studies describing how brands have used the feature to engage their audience.\nUser Generated Content (UGC) Asking your user-base for their content, images, videos, opinions or take on a brand-related-subject via #hashtagged or @mentioned tweets could be highly advantageous, although, timing, authenticity, and customer-care issues could result in a backlash bigger than any campaign.\nThis article presents some of these backlashes from brands attempting to engage UGC.\nPrized Contests \u0026amp; Promotions There could be no better way to engage your audience, generate hype, leads, subscriptions, conversions, and even UGC, like a prized contest. You may choose your winner in any number of ways, either editors-pick, most engagements collected, at random, or even give a prize to all participants as a promotion. Your prize must be something that users find valuable, but also something that’s connected to your brand. You can even give out coupons for your services at reduced prices.\nThis article covers several success stories of brands engaging in promotions \u0026amp; contests\nTweetChat Similar to Reddit’s AMA (Ask-Me-Anything), TweetChats are a prescheduled Q\u0026amp;A with a person of interest on our brand’s account. It could be with a company director or employee, or even a 3rd party influencer. Tweetchats are hosted via a specific #hashtag for the conversation, thus any tweets using the hashtag during the Q\u0026amp;A timeframe, are monitored via tools such as Twubs TwitterDeck or simply via Twitter’s own search function. It’s highly important to promote the TweetChat several days before it takes place, use a unique hashtag for the conversation and pick an appropriate time when your target audience is most engaged.\nHere’s a brief case study of Hero MotoCorp’s #RideSafeIndia campaign.\nAlso, This article on the medical #ChatAFib tweetchat, tells the story of an award-winning campaign.\nLive Stream (via Periscope) Similar to FB Live, Periscope is Twitter\u0026rsquo;s social live streaming service, offering to live stream and publish videos for up to 24 hours, at which time the video is removed. Broadcasting on periscope in conjunction with a targeted twitter campaign can work wonders for a brand. Asking user opinions and offering prizes like Delissio’s case study, could work wonders as well.\nHere’s a case study of Turkish Airlines combined Twitter \u0026amp; Periscope campaign. \nEngaging Content It’s no news that Twitter is highly news-oriented, most likely being the first platform with breaking stories and insights. Using tools such as Google alerts and google trends is a great way to create high-performing news content, though it’s advisable to connect the content to your brand. Product and industry.\nThis post on Twitter\u0026rsquo;s Blog offers some more insights on the best ways to engage your audience.\nTools \u0026amp; Templates Below are several products, services, and references to assist you in tackling the challenge of hacking your growth in reach and engagement.\n   TYPE PRODUCT     Engagement Analytics Twitter Analytics   Impression Analytics Twitter Ads   Keyword Research Hashtagify   #Hashtag base live conversation tool Twubs   Location based keyword research TrendsMap   Community Analytics Tool Twitonomy   Account Analytics Tool TweeTails    Conclusion While Twitter can be a bit of an exhaustive affair, demanding a lot more content and attention to ongoing conversations throughout the day, it’s exactly those fluid communities and conversations that offer even relatively new and unrecognized brands a viable opportunity to shine.\n"

	"content": " Analytics is often confused for ‘collect all the data you possibly can so you can analyze it, one day’, That is definitely not the case, and even before we start collecting any data at all, we should be able to define what data-points we want to collect and what how they would fit in to a bigger picture and purpose which would be derived from our pre-defined campaign goals i.e\nConversion, Action, Engagement, Feedback \u0026amp; Trust These will dictate which components we should track and how we should set up our analytics funnel via the means and metrics available, such as:\nClick-through-rate (CTR) While are CTR is incredibly important at measuring the health of our list and our user engagement, it only indicates at how many people clicked a link, any link, in our email content. To understand our audience further we should take a look at how many have clicked on which of our links in an attempt to further capture their mindset \u0026amp; preferences.\nOpen Rate In any and all email marketing platforms, the open rate is measured via a small transparent image which is embedded within the email content. This image, often referred to as a pixel, when loaded in the user’s email client trigger’s the email status as open.\nUnfortunately, there are many email clients as well as email users that don’t allow image loading on either mobile, desktop or both, in such circumstance the pixel won’t load and won’t trigger the email status as opened, despite it actually been opened and read. With such users, you might see a click on a link despite the email not being opened.\nBounce In email marketing Bounce refers to an email which wasn’t delivered to the recipients.\nThese are split into types: Hard and Soft Bounces.\nA Hard Bounce refers to a permanent issue with the email address which appears to be non-existent, either due to a typo, a false email given, the closing of the email account, or other.\nA Soft Bounce refers a temporary issue with the email address such as a full mailbox, an auto-reply due to vacation or other, the recipient\u0026rsquo;s email server being down, the message being too large for the recipients\u0026rsquo; inbox, or your email being blocked.\nWeb Engagement Using our email marketing platform’s available analytics integrations or even simpler by using UTM codes to direct our campaign audience through to our website we’ll be able to segment them to our campaign in most if not all of our existing analytics platforms, thus allowing us to view their subsequent behaviour on our website.\nEmail Client Whether your recipients open their email on mobile or desktop and which email client they use could tell you a lot of your user base as well as how your emails appear for each due to HTML rendering discrepancies from client to client. Thus instead of checking how your emails appear on every single client out there, you’ll be able to run QA only on those clients used by your recipients.\nTiming \u0026amp; Geolocation Sending to a list with various timezones can be cumbersome, with your email reaching some mid-morning, starting their day when they get to the office, and others in the middle of the night appearing as another of several emails received without context and seldom engaged on that day if at all.\nSegmenting your lists depending on timezones \u0026amp; geolocations and optimizing on the best time-of-day and day-of-week to send certain types of emails to your specific user base is acute to your optimization process, campaign performance and list health.\nCopy \u0026amp; design While researching the web for best practices on how to design and phrase your marketing emails you’ll find a lot of general or industry-specific advice, performance data, and rules. Take notice that while these are indeed helpful and can offer genuine insight, they are not certain when pertaining to your product and email list.\nWhen conflicted between two different email design or copywriting, the tests you conduct, and the data you gather is what you know about your audience. The rest are but hypotheses, even if appearing as conclusive evidence on a research already conducted by a different brand, it’s their brand and their audience, not yours.\nAutomation flow Automation flow optimization isn’t available on every email marketing platform (MailChimp for example) and though there are workarounds such as conducting an A/B test which refers to two different flows, true automation flow optimization is a powerful feature, allowing you to test the different properties of each email, the flow and timing. ActiveCampaign is a great example of this features’ wholistic approach for campaign optimization.\n"

	"content": " Introduction Instagram (IG) is a mobile-first photo and video sharing platform offering two types of publishing formats, one is a post featuring an image or video with a description, the other is a story, featuring an ephemeral image or video with face-filters, stickers, polls and more all embedded in your story so there’s no further text attached it.\nSince the launch of its Stories feature aimed at battling it out with Snapchat moments, Instagram seems to have unilaterally conquered the stories market, good move Zuckerberg 👏\nThroughout 2017 Instagram has added an enormous amount of features aimed both at user engagement and business and advertisers. Features such as face-filters during live-stream and direct BigCommerce shopping integration, hmm.\nAccount Setup Setting up your IG business account is pretty straightforward, as can be reviewed here and here. Make sure to fill in all your details (below) so leads can easily find and engage you.\n* Profile picture - 110x110 px, circular * Website (URL) - The URL can be changed throughout your account lifespan to feature specific campaigns and landing pages in place of your homepage. * Bio (description) - you may use *#hashtags* * Email * Phone number * Address * Connected accounts - FB, twitter, etc. * Start following - industry influencers correlating to your brand keywords.  Organic Marketing Branding Posts A standard post contains either a picture or video attached to the description with text, #hashtags, @mentions and a geo-tag. IG allows you to run these posts through a color-filter giving images a distinct style. while private users tend to use these filters to give each image a unique style, successful brands use them to give their entire brand that same unique vibe by choosing a standard or custom filter and applying it consistently to each of their posts, allowing their content to be instantly recognizable, in time.\nPosts may include up to 10 images and videos allowing for a broader story to be told through context.\nStories Stories, which have a 24-hour life-span and are then deleted, feature face-filters, stickers, #hashtags, @mentiones, interactive polls, geolocations, text and a lot more all embedded in your picture/video making them standalone, with no description attached to them. Here’s a complete guide to this feature-filled medium.\nWhile stories aren’t long lasting you can leverage popular stories you’ve posted via screenshots you’d then post back to IG or even use them as stickers in another story.\nLive The live stream feature available via stories comes naked from all those amazing features we were getting used to from the regular stories. So it’s a plain live stream with the possibility to make it available for the next 24 hours. You can take screenshots of your story after the fact to post it back to IG or use’em as stickers in another one of your stories.\nInspiration Since Instagram is such a limited platform in terms of functionality, marketers have to be exceptionally creative in order to create audience engagement with such limited resources.\n Sprout article - There’s a lot to learn from the brands presented in this article, from multi-account segmentation to brand engagement. Do take time to look up the actual brands on IG and not just sift through the article.\n Adobe - featuring artists using their products and hosting competitions such as #PeekAtProccess and #AdobeRemix, Adobe is hot with a capital H, do take some time to review their IG profiles.\n TechCrunch article - since most of these are celeb brands which are not so akin to the brands you’ll be working on, please focus on storytelling techniques and branding user-generated content (UGC) which are a surefire way of engaging your target audience.\n  Community Reach Community reach is extremely important in IG, as we mentioned you can @mention users in your post description as well on your stories. Also when commenting on user stories you can attach a photo of their story and use it as a sticker in yours, which is an amazing way to have a visual and engaging conversation with your audience.\nMarketing Since you can’t attach URLs to your posts or stories, marketing efforts are practically non-existent on IG thus they are dependent results of your branding efforts and your profile set up i.e when you have engaging brand content on the IG platform and properly filled out your profile with a website URL, phone number etc. leads will come, unfortunately for us we can’t really force it as with other platforms where it’s possible to construct posts with calls-to-action (CTAs), links, etc\nWhat you can do is change your website URL to a specific campaign or landing page at certain times when your branding efforts shift from your homepage message. You can always change it back to your homepage when these efforts come to an end.\nOne exception to this grim reality are IG Verified accounts who can attach URLs to their stories. The problem appears to be that there’s no genuine manner in which to request or attain an IG verified account, they’re just a Fugazi.\nThe second exception to this rule is instagram\u0026rsquo;s BigCommerce integration allowing you, as an e-commerce advertiser, to post your product catalog on Instagram where users can click and shop right from IG 🤑\nThe second and only exception to this rule is instagram\u0026rsquo;s BigCommerce integration allowing you, as an e-commerce advertiser, to post your product catalog on Instagram where users can click and shop right from IG 🤑\nSocial Analytics Market Research While understanding our competitors is quite important, understanding our audience is valuable as well.\nInstagram offers in-depth insights regarding the audience engaging with our brand. Starting from 100+ followers you’ll have the following information at your disposal:\n Gender\n Age group\n Top Locations (cities) of your followers\n Follower Hours - Hours of day your followers are engaged.\n Follower Days- Days of week your followers are engaged.\n  OKRs Below are several suggested OKRs \u0026amp; KPIs aimed at measuring your continuous success on Instagram.\n Reach   * Account Followers * Post Impressions / Reach * Profile Views   Engagement   * Account Website URL Clicks * Account Call Clicks * Account Mail Clicks * Account Mentions * Branded #Hashtags in user posts * Post Likes * Post Comments * Post Saves * Video Post Views * Story Impressions / Reach * Story Exits * Story Replies   Behaviour \u0026amp; Conversion Rate   * Measured on our own domain via GA, Mixpanel etc. For suggested KPIs check SMM Fundamentals.  Social Media Optimization (SMO) There are many different tactics available for you to try out and optimize in order to best reach and engage your audience. Below are several of those for your inspiration. I’d advise against counting on them alone but continuously research what sort of tactics have worked or might work well for your brand, industry and audience, and do not forget to measure the result of the tactics you engage against your original OKRs, in contrast to counting on any and all available metrics which might result in a focus on vanity metrics with no real impact on the business.\nOpinion Polls Unlike other platforms, IG is very visual, thus your polling story should be visually engaging as well. Opinion polls are available via IG Stories, allowing for two-predetermined-opinions, and viewing polling results per user. Though the story, as well as the poll results, disappear after a short 24 hours.\nOnce your polling is almost done, and before your story is deleted, make sure to take screenshots of the poll results along with your story to post back to IG once more, This should re-engage the same user base within the same context, it couldn’t get better than that.\nUser Generated Content (UGC) Asking users for content such as images or #hashtagged stories could be an awesome, growth-driving endeavor if done with authenticity, and user-centric thinking. It could also easily backlash if done with a brand-centric perspective. Turns out users like feeling included but now feeling used, shocker.\nThis HubSpot article features several success stories for UGC generating campaigns on IG.\nPrized Contests \u0026amp; Promotions There could be no better way to engage your audience, generate hype, leads, subscriptions, conversions, and even UGC, like a prized contest. You may choose your winner in any number of ways, either editors-pick, most engagements collected, at random, or even give a prize to all participants as a promotion. Your prize must be something that users find valuable, but also something that’s connected to your brand. You can even give out coupons for your services at reduced prices.\nThis article features several UGC, Influencer or Promotion including Pacific Northwest’s incredible promotion campaign on IG stories.\nLive Stream Live streaming is a great way to engage your audience, offer live prizes and promotions, direct to your website URL or campaign landing page, and get more followers. Before streaming, make sure to publish posts and stories promoting the live stream at the time \u0026amp; date.\nThis article by Later, an IG publishing platform, gives us a thorough examination of IG Live applications\nEngaging Content Social users love useful content, you could try uploading stories and or bulk-posts with multiple images to explain how to do something related to your brand.\nTools \u0026amp; Templates    TYPE PRODUCT     Account \u0026amp; Audience Analytics Instagram Analytics (Available inside the mobile app)   Account Analytics SimplyMeasured   Account Analytics Squarelovin   Account \u0026amp; Keyword Analytics Keyhole   Account Analytics Websta   Account \u0026amp; Competitor Analytics INK361   Account \u0026amp; Audiance Analytics SocialRank   Suggested KPIs SpreadShare SMM KPI Cheatsheet    Conclusion Instagram is a very different platform from both FB and Twitter and is much closer to Snapchat than anything else. While converting users can be challenging, it can be done by having an i distinct brand image, engaging visual conversations and full-features posts telling a real story about your brand and it’s users.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " List Compilation Often times you’ll hear people suggesting to purchase an email list from a 3rd part in order to start you out, trust that this is a horrendous idea leaving you only with low engagement, higher vulnerability to spam filters, and an audience which though seemingly close from first impression, is in fact far from being your target.\nIn order to collect email subscribers, we’ll collaborate with our content, social media marketing and product teams as to create points of contact in which our target audience might actually be willing to subscribe to our emails, as well as using our own resources to create those points of contact.\nA few examples might include:\n A call to action on our social media posts or even profile directing our follower-base to register to one of our email lists. A form and call to action at the end of a content piece or content-segment in our website or blog, for visitors to register for future content updates. A call to action on different types of emails such as welcome emails, or transactional emails, directing the recipient to register to receive other types of updates and content we’re offering Having a dedicated page for registering to your different email services such as topical newsletters, deals \u0026amp; offers, etc. Attach an email form to an offer on your website such as an exclusive ebook, webinar, discount, trial freemium service, etc. Have an exit pop-up on your website compelling the visitor to subscribe via the written above, or even just a highly personalized message. Have a connect with Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. on your app or website will also deliver their email address.  All of these different points of contact have a common denominator- In each one, you’ll need to firmly establish the value your subscribers will receive as part of their subscription and in exchange for their registration, both ‘right now’ as well as throughout the email campaign, delivering value each time anew, as best you can. Do advise with your content, SMM and product lead for opportunities to join subscribers to your email list.\nList Maintenance Maintaining our list involves removing recipients with whom we encounter a hard bounce, or that consistently don’t receive our emails due to soft bounces, and that consistently don’t engage with our emails despite receiving them.\nThe health of our list will establish our long-term positions with different email servers and their spam-filters. Failing to maintain that health so may result in losing a greater audience than just a single recipient.\nWhile hard bounces are a trivial matter of removing as soon as possible, different email marketing platforms have different ways of dealing with soft bounces, do check the documentation of your email platform in order to see how soft bounces will be handled, as well as check the code numbers for each specific type of soft bounce.\nThere’s no doubt that you should try again with soft bounces, diminishing message size and sending at different times. Though when you have established consistency of soft bounces with the recipient you should remove them from your list.\nWhile it may seem intuitive that we should target and deliver to any valid email address in our possession, there are two things to keep in mind,\none is avoiding spam filters- when you consistently engage with recipients who have put you in their spam-box, your email address will be inductively spam-filter on the server, in severe cases your email marketing platform may even suspend your account. This, of course, won’t be a matter of a single recipient, but a trend in your general email activity.\nThus it is highly advised to remove recipients who have consistently been disengaged with your messages both in open-rate and CTR.\nThe other is correlating email engagement to user activity on our website which could point to a failure in message personalization, in contrast, to complete recipient disengagement from the brand.\n"

Along with their organic content, they started including content curated from other brands as well as entertaining images targeting their audience. Their articulated new strategy named Edu-tainment focuses on educational, thoughtful and valuable insights as well as funny, relatable and entertaining content. If a piece of content can relate to both these fields simultaneously all the better, though being affiliated with just one side of the coin works just as well.\nWith their new minimized strategy Buffer managed to increase both their reach and user engagement on Facebook by 3X.\nOriginal Case Study on Buffer\u0026rsquo;s Blog\nPOSHme on Facebook POSHme is an emerging Czech-based online female-fashion-retailer targeting a female audience ranging from 26-45 years old located in Czech and Slovakia.
